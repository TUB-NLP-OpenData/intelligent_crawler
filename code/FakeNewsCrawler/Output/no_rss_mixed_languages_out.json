          "title": "Podcast Twenty Twenty: le combat d'une mère",
          "text": "Podcast Twenty Twenty: le combat d'une mère\n\nWashington - L'aventure Twenty Twenty a commencé fin janvier avec un objectif : raconter la campagne présidentielle américaine en s'appuyant sur les journalistes de l'AFP dans tout le pays, ils sont près de 120 en Amérique du nord ! Comme tous les quatre ans, le monde fait sienne cette échéance politique, celle de la première puissance mondiale, représentant encore 17% de l’économie mondiale, dont les choix politiques ont des répercussions globales.\n\nLa primaire démocrate s’est achevée sur une victoire plutôt rapide de Joe Biden, l’ancien vice-président de Barack Obama. Il doit encore être investi par son parti, mais sauf surprise, il sera le candidat des démocrates. Le coronavirus a fait son entrée sur la scène de manière presque simultanée. Nous avons alors débattu: Twenty Twenty devait-il basculer sur la couverture de cette crise sans précédent ? La réponse était évidente: oui. En couvrant cette crise, puis l’émergence d’un mouvement inédit contre le racisme à la suite de la mort de George Floyd, notre podcast donnerait à voir aussi cette Amérique qui ira aux urnes en novembre, ses failles et ses débats. Chaque épisode est donc un long format, pour mieux comprendre.\n\nPour le 20ème numéro… TwentyTwenty a souhaité se concentrer sur une seule protagoniste du mouvement Black Lives Matter, une mère.\n\nSur son t-shirt, sur son masque, Marion Gray-Hopkins, 64 ans, affiche le même visage souriant, celui de son fils de 19 ans, Gary ou \"LG\" pour \"Little Gary\". Un soir de novembre 1999, à la sortie d'une soirée dansante ce jeune noir américain est tué par la police. Le policier qui a ouvert le feu a été acquitté lors de son procès. Depuis, Marion Gray-Hopkins a voué une grande partie de sa vie à honorer la mémoire de Gary en militant contre les violences policières qui chaque année font environ mille morts selon le Washington Post et tuent de manière disproportionnée les Noirs américains.\n\nMontage photo réalisé à partir d'images cédées par la famille Gray-Hopkins\n\nMarion Gray-Hopkins a co-fondé \"Coalition of concerned mothers\", une association qui accompagne les mères dans leur combat pour obtenir justice ou pour apaiser leur peine après le décès d'un enfant aux mains de la police ou par armes à feu.\n\nJe l'ai rencontrée un jour ensoleillé de juin. Elle s'est assise devant sa maison dans laquelle elle venait d'emménager dans le Maryland, à 45 minutes de route au sud de la capitale américaine et m'a raconté son histoire et celle de ce fils.\n\nIl avait enfilé de beaux habits de son père, emporté par un cancer seulement deux semaines plus tôt. Et il est parti se changer les idées, avec amis et cousins. Il n'est pas revenu, tué par balle par la police.\n\nLa conversation, tenue à bonne distance, coronavirus oblige, a duré une heure. Au moment d'évoquer la vidéo où l'on voit George Floyd asphyxié sous le genou d'un policier blanc, Marion Gray-Hopkins a marqué une pause et répondu, la voix nouée par l'émotion : \"Chacun de ces meurtres me renvoie à ce traumatisme du 27 novembre 1999\". Mais la mère et la grand-mère ne lâchera rien : \"Je me battrais jusqu'à la mort pour ceux qui restent\": ses petits enfants, ses filles, son autre fils.\n\nBus recouvert d'une représentation de l'ancien esclave Harriet Tubman à Houston dans l'Etat du Texas, le 8 juin 2020 (AFP / Andrew Caballero-reynolds) Peinture murale de l'artiste Vincent Ballentine à Brooklyn, dans l'Etat de New York, le 16 juin 2020 (AFP / Angela Weiss)\n\nMarion Gray-Hopkins a désormais l'espoir que ce vaste mouvement de protestation commence enfin à faire bouger les lignes. Après notre rencontre, elle m'a demandé de mentionner l'anniversaire de son fils, son \"heavenly birthday\"-- son anniversaire au paradis. Le 5 juin 2020, \"Little Gary\" aurait eu 40 ans.\n\nMarion Gray-Hopkins, le 21 février 2017 à Rio de Janeiro lors d'une conférence de presse organisée par Amnesty international (AFP / Yasuyoshi Chiba)\n\nJ'ai été très ému par le témoignage de Marion Gray-Hopkins, qui 20 ans après la mort de son fils se bat toujours. J'ai été marqué par la force de son propos et par son émotion souvent contenue. Sa peine, son combat mais aussi ses espoirs donnent à réfléchir et permettent de mieux saisir l'ampleur du problème des inégalités raciales aux Etats-Unis.\n\n(Photo courtesy of the Gray-Hopkins family)\n\nGary Hopkins aurait eu 40 ans le 5 juin.",

          "title": "Who Killed Paul Guihard ? Part 2 (podcast)",
          "text": "Who Killed Paul Guihard ? Part 2 (podcast)\n\nAs protests against police brutality and racism roil the United States, AFP remembers one of its own, reporter Paul Guihard, the only journalist killed during the US civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s.\n\nBelow please find a 2019 podcast on our investigation into his killing, which remains unsolved.\n\nBeneath the Mississippi moon, somebody better investigate soon — When President Kennedy delivered the first sentence of his address to the nation in the early evening of September 30, 1962, “James Meredith is now in residence on the campus of the University of Mississippi,” he didn't know that US marshals who had come under attack from protesters all afternoon on campus had started to fire teargas.\n\nSoon a riot exploded on the scene, fueled by hundreds of segregationists who had come to Ole Miss from other states to “defend” it against the enrollment of its first African-American student. AFP reporter Paul Guihard and photographer Sammy Schulman split up to cover the unrest. They had no idea that Guihard would never return alive.\n\nThe second episode of our podcast retraces the aftermath of the riot and Paul Guihard’s murder as well as the admission to Ole Miss of James Meredith. It also looks at the various investigations of Paul Guihard’s death from 1962 to 2011, when his file was closed by the US Department of Justice.\n\nPodcast\n\nSidna Brower, who in 1962 was the editor of the Ole Miss student newspaper “The Mississippian,” recalled the events following her editorial calling for law and order. Brower, then 21, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for the piece.\n\n“This is an appeal to the entire student body and to anyone concerned with the present situation. Not only do the students chance forfeiting their education by participating in riots, but they are bringing dishonor and shame to the University and the State of Mississippi…”\n\nThe picture above is one of the most famous images of James Meredith at the University of Mississippi. Surrounded by federal forces and news photographers, he arrived on campus on October 1, 1962. Some 300 journalists covered the event.\n\nWe didn’t find the pictures taken during the riot by AFP photographer Sammy Schulman, neither at Paris headquarters nor the New York bureau. What happened to them ? We know that Schulman took a few rolls of pictures, since Sidna Brower said she was in the darkroom with him when he was developing the film and they both learned that Guihard had been killed.\n\nSchulman’s name often appears on the contact sheets that AFP has of the Kennedy presidency. He was one of AFP photographers who covered the Kennedy inauguration on January 20, 1961.\n\n(Photo Éric Baradat / AFP)\n\nThe photo above is of Paul Guihard’s 1962 French press card. It was found in a file of Guihard documents at AFP’s Washington bureau that also included his French and British passports as well as official papers and a newspaper clipping. When reading it, I discovered an article of Greenwich Village’s “The Villager” that said Guihard had produced a 1962 drama called “The Deck Chair” which was played during a five-month run at Cafe Bizarre at West 3rd Street in New York City. The one-act comedy play is about a shipwrecked sailor and an exiled officer who destroy themselves on a tiny island because of the officer’s intransigence.\n\nA memorandum of the United States government on Guihard’s case was one of many documents that were declassified, but with the names of the witnesses deleted.\n\nA manuscript note on top right reads “Re: Pierre Salinger statement.” Salinger was an American journalist who served as a White House Press Secretary for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Salinger, whose grandfather was a member of the French parliament, was very popular on French television from the 1970s to his death in 2004. He was one of the favorite American guests of French news programs, especially during US elections. His loud voice and strong American accent were very distinctive. Salinger, who was a francophile, spent his later years and died in Provence, southern France and was interred at the Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe AFP interactive team in Paris, Laurent Kalfala, Yana Dlugy, and the journalists who lent their voices to the “Who killed Paul Guihard?” podcast are proud to pay tribute to their colleague killed in 1962. Paul Guihard is the third name on the list of the 23 AFP journalists and employees killed on duty and one two whose deaths remain unsolved…\n\nWho killed Paul Guihard? is a production of the Interactive Graphics Team at AFP. Design by Fred Bourgeais and Jacky Fong; illustrations by David Lory; text editing by Yana Dlugy; file pictures by Cecile Cadel.\n\nThanks to Gina Doggett, Abhik Chanda and Yana Dlugy for their voices in the second episode and to the AFP Washington bureau for the documents.\n\nThe podcast was produced by Laurent Kalfala.\n\nWith : Kathleen Wickham , Hank Klibanoff , Sidna Brower and Don Emmert.

          "text": "Podcast: Qui a tué Paul Guihard ? La suite.\n\nDes reporters de l’Agence France-Presse couvraient déjà, dans les années 1960, le combat des Afro-Américains pour l’égalité de leurs droits et notamment les émeutes qui les avaient alors ponctuées. Un seul journaliste est mort durant ces années de lutte pour les droits civiques, et il travaillait pour l’AFP. Paul Guihard a été tué par balle, à bout portant, lors d’une émeute à Oxford, dans l’Etat du Mississippi, suscitée par l’arrivée d’un premier étudiant noir à l’université Ole Miss, James Meredith.\n\nVoici le deuxième volet de notre podcast en anglais sur ces événements, “Who killed Paul Guihard”? produit par Laurent Kalfala, journaliste chargé de projet au service Infographie & Innovation... Où l'on plonge dans une période mouvementée de l'histoire américaine, non sans liens avec les secousses qui agitent les Etats-Unis depuis la mort de George Floyd, asphyxié par un policier le 25 mai.\n\nPortrait mural de George Floyd, à Houston, au Texas, le 8 juin 2020 (AFP / Johannes Eisele)\n\n“James Meredith est désormais résident sur le campus de l’Université de Mississippi”: ce furent les premiers mots de l'allocution télévisée de John F. Kennedy, le 30 septembre 1962.\n\nLe monde n’avait pas de chaîne info 24/24, ni de réseaux sociaux, et le président américain ne savait pas qu’alors même qu'il parlait, les forces de l’ordre avaient commencé à faire usage de gaz lacrymogènes sur le campus. Des émeutes s’ensuivirent, menées par des centaines de ségrégationnistes. Paul Guihard et le photographe Sammy Schulman décidèrent de se séparer, pour couvrir ces troubles.\n\nLe deuxième volet de notre podcast détaille les lendemains de cette nuit de violence et de l’assassinat de Paul Guihard, ainsi que les premiers pas de James Meredith à l’université.\n\nSidna Brower, alors rédactrice en chef du “Mississippian,” âgée de seulement 21 ans, lança un appel “à l’ensemble du corps étudiant et à toute personne que la situation inquiéterait\". “Non seulement les étudiants risquent de compromettre leur cursus en participant aux émeutes, mais ils déshonorent l’Université de l’Etat du Mississippi”, avait-elle écrit, dans un texte qui lui valut une nomination aux prix Pulitzer.\n\n\n\nSur ces images on voit notamment James Meredith (à droite), entouré de membres de la Garde nationale et de photographes, lors de son arrivée au campus le 1er octobre 1962.\n\nNous n’avons trouvé aucune photographie des émeutes signée par Sammy Schulman. Nous sommes certains qu’il a bien pris des photos puisqu’il a utilisé la chambre noire du “Mississippian” pour les développer. Où sont passées ces images ? Nous l’ignorons. Son nom apparaît en revanche régulièrement dans nos archives, associé à des informations en lien avec la présidence de Kennedy. Il faisait d'ailleurs partie de l'équipe qui avait couvert son investiture, le 20 janvier 1961.\n\nL’enquête sur la mort du journaliste s’étala sur presque 50 ans, jusqu’en 2011, avant d’être refermée, sans résultat, par le Département américain de la Justice.\n\n(Photo Éric Baradat / AFP)\n\nImage de la carte de presse de Paul Guihard en 1962, retrouvée dans le dossier du journaliste conservé dans les archives de notre bureau à Washington. Nous y avons aussi trouvé ses passeports Français et Britannique, des documents officiels et des coupures de presse. Nous avons même appris grâce à ces archives que Guihard avait produit, en 1962, une pièce de théâtre, “The Deck Chair”, jouée pendant cinq mois au Café Bizarre, à New York. La comédie dépeint le huis clos d’un marin naufragé et d’un officier exilé qui se déchirent sur une île déserte. Nous avons aussi retrouvé un mémo du gouvernement américain, déclassifié, où les noms des témoins ont été masqués.\n\nNos remerciements à Gina Doggett, Abhik Chanda et Yana Dlugy qui ont prêté leurs voix pour ce deuxième épisode et au bureau de Washington pour ses archives.\n\nWho killed Paul Guihard ? est un podcast en anglais produit en 2019 par Laurent Kalfala et l'équipe infographie interactive de l'AFP avec graphisme de Fred Bourgeais, illustrations de David Lory et édition texte de Yana Dlugy et Michaëla Cancela-Kieffer.

          "text": "Podcast: qui a tué Paul Guihard ? Une histoire dans l'histoire des émeutes raciales\n\nDes reporters de l’Agence France-Presse couvraient déjà, dans les années 1960, les luttes des Afro-Américains pour l’égalité de leurs droits et notamment les émeutes qui les avaient alors ponctuées. Un seul journaliste est mort durant ces années de lutte pour les droits civiques, et il travaillait pour l’AFP. Paul Guihard, a été tué par balle, à bout portant, lors d’une émeute à Oxford, dans l’Etat du Mississippi, suscitée par l’arrivée d’un premier étudiant noir à l’université Ole Miss, James Meredith.\n\nNous rediffusons cette semaine “Who killed Paul Guihard”? un podcast en anglais sur ces événements produit par Laurent Kalfala. Il nous replonge dans cette période mouvementée, alors que de nouvelles émeutes raciales secouent les Etats-Unis depuis la mort de George Floyd, asphyxié par un policier le 25 mai.\n\nPaul Guihard\n\nLe dimanche 30 septembre 1962, le journaliste Paul Guihard et le photographe Sammy Schulman de l’Agence France-Presse à New York s’envolent pour l’Etat du Mississippi, au coeur du sud-est américain. L’actualité vaut le déplacement: dans la petite ville universitaire d’Oxford, ils doivent couvrir un des moments forts de la lutte pour les droits civils aux Etats-Unis. James Meredith doit y faire son entrée à l’université, devenant ainsi le premier Noir admis sur le campus, et la tension est à son comble.\n\nLa Garde nationale a été appelée en renfort pour assurer sa protection. Le monde retient son souffle. Plus de 300 journalistes ont fait le déplacement. Paul Guihard et Sammy Schulman, pour leur part, ne sont sans doute pas très inquiets car ils ne manquent pas d’expérience des situations dangereuses.\n\n(Photo Éric Baradat / AFP)\n\nJames Meredith, un vétéran de l'armée de l'air âgé de 29 ans, se battait depuis près d'un et demi devant les tribunaux pour être admis dans cette université, qui refusait les Noirs. Paul, un franco-anglais qui ne se séparait jamais de sa veste en tweed, avait servi dans l’armée britannique. Sammy, installé à New York depuis plusieurs années avait couvert presque 20 ans plus tôt, le débarquement des alliés et la Libération de Paris en tant que photographe militaire américain. En ce dimanche de septembre, ils filent sans le savoir vers une tragédie.\n\nPhotographie prise par Sammy Schulman le 10 décembre 1960, jour du baptême de John F. Kennedy junior\n\nLe 30 septembre 1962 donc, Schulman et Guihard font donc équipe pour couvrir les émeutes.\n\nSidna Brower, la rédactrice en chef du « Mississippian », le journal de l’université, a ouvert les portes des locaux de son journal aux reporters qui couvrent l'événement. Schulman y développait ses clichés, dans la chambre noire, quand un étudiant a ouvert la porte …\n\n“Un reporter a été tué ! ”, a crié l'étudiant. “Oh mon dieu, mais c'est mon homme!\", s'est exclamé Schulman.\n\nDans la soirée, le président John F. Kennedy s’était exprimé de manière solennelle, afin d’expliquer sa décision de déployer la Garde nationale pour accompagner Meredith. Alors même qu’il s’adressait aux Américains, les émeutes gagnaient le campus d’Ole Miss. Des centaines d’opposants à la cause des droits civils avaient déferlé, venus d’autres Etats du sud des Etats-Unis, bien décidés à mener “la dernière bataille de la guerre de sécession”, comme l’avaient écrit des reporters couvrant ces événements.\n\nNon loin d’un dortoir du campus en proie aux échauffourées, un corps gisait à terre, sur le dos. C’était celui de Paul Guihard, découvert par un groupe d’étudiants qui, croyant à une crise cardiaque, tenta même de le ranimer. Dans l’obscurité, ils ne virent pas que sa veste en tweed était imbibée de sang. Guihard, avait été tué d’une balle dans le dos, tirée à moins d’un mètre.\n\nWho killed Paul Guihard ? a été produit en 2019 par Laurent Kalfala et l'équipe infographie interactive de l'AFP. Graphisme de Fred Bourgeais, illustrations de David Lory . Edition par Yana Dlugy et Michaëla Cancela-Kieffer. Images d’archives : Cecile Cadel.\n\nAvec Kathleen Wickham, Hank Klibanoff, Sidna Brower, Don Emmert, Michel Nouaillas et Francois Pelou.

          "text": "Cette vidéo d’inondations n’a pas été filmée à Abidjan, mais en Corse\n\nUne vidéo de neuf minutes partagée près de 3.000 fois sur Facebook depuis le 15 juin prétend montrer des inondations dans les rues d’Abidjan. La capitale économique ivoirienne est frappée par de fortes pluies qui ont provoqué inondations et glissements terrains et fait au moins 13 morts. Mais ces images d'un torrent d'eau dans une rue n’ont pas été filmées à Abidjan: elles montrent des inondations qui ont eu lieu le 11 juin à Ajaccio, en Corse.\n\nAbidjan, la capitale économique de la Côte d'Ivoire, est entrée début mai dans la saison des pluies. Les pluies diluviennes ont provoqué inondations et accidents mortels.\n\nJeudi 18 juin, au moins 13 personnes ont perdu la vie dans un glissement de terrain à Anyma, dans la banlieue nord d’Abidjan.\n\nSur les réseaux sociaux ivoiriens, de nombreuses vidéos montrent des rues inondées et des dégâts causés par la pluie.\n\nSur l’une d’entre elles, filmée depuis les étages d’un immeuble, on voit des voitures et des poubelles emportées par un puissant courant de couleur ocre.

Ces publications affirment qu’il s’agit d’une délégation d’Européens qui aurait apporté des \"vaccins\". Selon le Programme alimentaire mondial et les autorités locales, il s'agit en réalité d'une délégation de l'organisation humanitaire venue pour identifier des bénéficiaires d’aide alimentaire, et qui a dû quitter les lieux après avoir été pris à partie par des jeunes lui reprochant de ne pas faire appel à la main-d'oeuvre locale.\n\nUn véhicule 4x4 blanc qui s’en va, suivi d’un pick-up de la police, dans un tohu-bohu de musique et de huées de la foule massée au bord de la route.\n\n\"Le vaccin chassé par les jeunes de Masisi cet après-midi\", affirme une publication Facebook partagée près d’un millier de fois depuis le 11 juin.\n\nCapture d'écran Facebook, réalisée le 19 juin 2020\n\nUne autre publication, diffusée le lendemain, avec la même vidéo affirme: \"La population de Masisi vient de chasser la délégation de l'union Européenne qui soit disant est venue avec des vaccins anti Coronavirus. Le peuple n'a même pas attendue car les rumeurs couraient déjà\" (sic).\n\nCes messages sont relayés dans un contexte tendu sur le continent africain où, avec la propagation de la pandémie de Covid-19, de puissantes rumeurs circulant notamment sur les réseaux sociaux affirment qu’un vaccin contre le nouveau coronavirus sera testé en Afrique.\n\nEn avril dernier, un groupe d’Européens avait été chassé par la foule dans la banlieue de Kinshasa, la capitale de la RDC, sous prétexte qu’ils transportaient des vaccins.\n\nUne récente visite d’une délégation de l’Union européenne en RDC dans le cadre d’un \"pont aérien humanitaire\" a ravivé ces rumeurs dans l’opinion.\n\nUne publication virale a notamment appelé la population à être vigilante sur la visite d’une délégation de l’Union européenne en RDC où, affirme-t-elle, \"l'heure est au vaccin et à la balkanisation de notre pays\". \"N'acceptons aucun traitement ou test de masse, refusons tout don en vivres, faisons obstacle à leur présence dans nos villages et territoires. Prenons-nous en charge. Ns ne leur avons rien demandé\" (sic), lance-t-elle.\n\nCe message est également largement relayé sur la messagerie Whatsapp depuis le 12 juin.\n\nCapture d'écran Whatsapp, réalisée le 19 juin 2020\n\nUn incident sans lien avec des vaccins\n\nEn visionnant la vidéo diffusée sur Facebook, on entend une personne relater la situation alors que le 4x4 blanc passe devant lui: \"Les voilà en train de partir ! C’est la délégation PAM qui rentre à Goma (grande ville de l’Est de la RDC, ndlr), refoulée par la jeunesse du territoire de Masisi, accompagnée par la police\".\n\nPAM est l’acronyme du Programme alimentaire mondial, agence de l’Onu pour la lutte contre la faim dans le monde. Sa mission n’a aucun lien avec les vaccins ou l’aide médicale.\n\nContacté le 17 juin, le service de communication du PAM en République démocratique du Congo a confirmé à l’AFP cet incident à Masisi, située à environ 80 km à l’ouest de Goma.\n\n\"Le 5 et 6 juin, lors d’une mission visant à identifier des bénéficiaires pour l’assistance alimentaire, le PAM a été pris à partie par un groupe de jeunes qui estimait que l’Organisation ne recrute pas suffisamment d’enquêteurs locaux\", a expliqué Claude Kalinga, chargé des relations avec la presse au sein du PAM.\n\n\"L’organisation recrute localement mais vu qu’elle travaille dans un très grand nombre de localités et que des travailleurs tels que des enquêteurs doivent être formés, il n’est pas faisable de recruter une nouvelle équipe dans chaque localité\", a-t-il justifié.\n\nMalgré les tentatives d’explication des personnels du PAM, \"certains jeunes ont toutefois continué de manifester leur hostilité, donc le PAM a mis fin à cette mission d’identification de bénéficiaires\".\n\n\"Un petit problème\"\n\nLes autorités locales de Masisi ont confirmé cette version.\n\n\"Je démens catégoriquement des rumeurs qui affirment que les jeunes s'en sont pris à la délégation de PAM parce qu’elle aurait emmené des vaccins\", a déclaré à l’AFP Cosmas Kangakolo, administrateur du territoire de Masisi.\n\n\"C’est plus un ras-le-bol exprimé par les jeunes de Masisi qui reproche à cette organisation d’embaucher toujours les compatriotes de Goma alors qu’il y a de la main-d'oeuvre dans le territoire de Masisi. C’est un constat que nous avons fait depuis deux ans déjà\", a-t-il ajouté.\n\n\"C’était un petit problème, la police était là pour sécuriser les membres du Programme alimentaire mondial\", a-t-il ajouté.\n\nPar ailleurs, malgré un grand nombre de projets scientifiques en cours, aucun vaccin contre le Covid-19 n’est disponible à l’heure actuelle.\n\nUn récent \"pont aérien\" de l’UE vers la RDC\n\nDans le cadre de la lutte contre le Covid-19, l’Union européenne a lancé le 8 juin un \"pont aérien\" afin d’acheminer vers la RDC médicaments, matériel médical et personnels humanitaires.\n\nLe premier des trois vols prévus vers la RDC est parti de Bruxelles le 8 juin, avec à bord Janez Lenarcic, commisssaire européen à la Gestion des crises, et les ministres français et belge des Affaires étrangères, Jean-Yves Le Drian et Philippe Goffin.\n\nCette délégation comptait 93 personnes, a précisé la représentation de l’UE en RDC, contactée par l’AFP le 17 juin.\n\n\"De Kinshasa à Goma, il y avait dans l’avion 16 personnes pour le compte de la délégation ministérielle européenne. Tous les passagers ont été testés négatifs au Covid-19\", a-t-elle précisé.\n\nL’Union européenne a détaillé sur son site internet les types de matériels expédiés: \"des purificateurs d'eau, un soutien nutritionnel et des fournitures médicales générales, d’autres fournitures, telles que du matériel de laboratoire, des masques, des gants et des équipements de protection individuelle, qui sont également destinées à soutenir la réaction face au coronavirus en RDC\".\n\nDepuis début mai, l'UE a organisé quatre autres vols humanitaires, trois vers la République centrafricaine et un vers São Tomé e Príncipe.\n\nAu total, l'Union européenne a alloué début avril à l'Afrique 3,25 milliards d'euros en financements et 1,4 milliard d'euros de prêts pour aider à couvrir les besoins des pays les plus touchés.",

          "text": "Le vrai du faux d'une publication virale sur le coût du travail en France\n\nUne publication, partagée des milliers de fois depuis le 10 juin sur Facebook et qui circule depuis 2016, prétend détailler le \"coût du travail\" en France pour un patron d'entreprise, estimant que celui-ci est trop élevé. Il s'agit d'un texte contenant des généralisations et des imprécisions, expliquent des expertes à l'AFP.\n\n\"Voilà le coût du travail (...) voilà comment on a tué notre industrie et nos emplois\", regrette le billet, partagé 4.200 fois depuis le 10 juin 2020.\n\n(capture d'écran réalisée sur Facebook le 16 juin 2020)\n\nCe texte circule en réalité depuis août 2016. Présenté comme le coup de gueule d'un dirigeant d'entreprise, il a d'abord été relayé dans un billet d'humeur du quotidien Le Bien Public.\n\nLa rubrique de fact-checking du journal Le Monde avait réalisé un article de vérification sur ce texte le 31 août 2016.\n\nInterrogée par l'AFP afin de décrypter les méchanismes fiscaux détaillés dans la publication, Anne Guyot-Welke, porte-parole de Solidaires Finances Publiques - 1er syndicat de la Direction générale des finances publiques -, a estimé que ce texte était \"simpliste\" et \"très incomplet\".\n\nRevenons point par point sur les affirmations de la publication virale.\n\n\"Quand je donne 100 euros bruts à l’un de mes salariés, ça me coûte, avec les charges patronales, 150 euros. Sur ces 100 euros bruts, ce salarié va recevoir 70 euros nets\" Plutôt vrai\n\nSelon la publication, pour donner 100 euros bruts à un salarié, un employeur doit y ajouter 50 euros, prélevés en charges patronales.\n\nCes cotisations sont les principales ressources du régime général de la Sécurité sociale. Elles servent également à financer \"la retraite complémentaire, la prévoyance, les garanties chômage et la formation professionnelle de leurs salariés\", explique l'Urssaf.\n\n\"Quand on raisonne dans les grandes masses, l’ordre de grandeur correspond à peu près\", explique à l'AFP Gaelle Menu Lejeune, avocate et directrice du département droit fiscal du cabinet Fidal à Paris, joint par téléphone le 18 juin.\n\nIl n'existe pas un seul taux fixe de prélèvement pour toutes les entreprises françaises, mais une multitude de taux qui varient de plus en fonction de nombreux facteurs comme la taille de l'entreprise, le statut du salarié, etc. La liste de ces taux est disponible sur le site de l'Urssaf.\n\n(Capture d'écran du site de l'Urssaf le 17 juin 2020)\n\nSelon une étude de l'institut économique Molinari (IEM), un think tank libéral, les charges patronales représentent en moyenne 43% du salaire brut en France en 2019.\n\nMais ce n'est pas toujours le cas. \"Il y a des mécanismes d'exonération de charges\" pour les entreprises, note Mme Menu Lejeune.\n\nLes employeurs bénéficient par exemple \"d’une réduction générale des cotisations patronales\" sur les rémunérations n’excédant pas 1,6 Smic par an, écrit l'Urssaf sur son site. Dans certains cas, notamment pour les bas salaires donc, les charges patronales à verser pour un salarié peuvent être en deça de 43%.\n\nLes charges salariales, qui seront ensuite déduites du brut de l'employé, servent aussi à financer la Sécurité sociale, l’assurance chômage et les régimes de Retraite complémentaire.\n\nEn 2019, pour un salarié en France, les cotisations salariales sont de l'ordre de 30% du brut versé par l'entreprise, selon l'Institut Molinari. Comme pour les cotisations patronales, cela dépend toutefois de nombreux paramètres. Ces cotisations sont listées sur le site du gouvernement.\n\n\"Il y a énormément de variables. Mais si on ajoute les charges salariales et les charges patronales, cela représente en général 50 % du coût total dépensé par l'entreprise\", estime Gaelle Menu Lejeune.\n\n\"Comme il va être imposé sur le revenu à environ 30%, soit 21 euros\" Généralisation\n\n\"Si on parle de la moyenne des français, c'est beaucoup moins\", selon l'avocate fiscaliste Gaelle Menu Lejeune.\n\nPour être taxé à 30%, il faudrait que ce salarié touche entre 26.791 et 71.823 euros annuels,\"et ce n'est pas la majorité des salariés français\", abonde Anne Guyot-Welke de Solidaires dans un mail transmis à l'AFP le 15 juin.\n\nCe calcul prend en compte la situation familiale : un célibataire paiera davantage d'impôt qu'un salarié dont le conjoint ne déclare aucun revenu par exemple.\n\nSelon les chiffres de Solidaires, \"sur 38.332.977 foyers en France en 2018, 4.925.457 sont sur la tranche de 30% d'imposition\". Les tranches les plus représentées ensuite sont celles imposées à 0% (12.916.659 foyers) et 14% (20.013.306 foyers).\n\nDe plus, \"le système est progressif donc le salarié en question est taxé à 0% pour ses revenus allant jusqu'à 9.700 €, 14% pour ses revenus de 9700 à 26.791 et 30% de 26.791 à 71 .826\", dit Mme Guyot-Welke.\n\nEn 2016, selon les calculs du quotidien Le Monde, un célibataire devait \"gagner plus de 135 500 euros bruts par an, plus de sept fois le salaire minimal, pour atteindre le seuil d’imposition dénoncé par le chef d’entreprise\".\n\n\"Moins de 10 % des français supportent un taux d’imposition moyen de 30 % ou supérieur\", commente Mme Menu Lejeune.\n\n\"Ce qu'il va dépenser sera soumis à une TVA de 20%. Donc son pouvoir d'achat réel sera de 39 euros\" Partiellement faux\n\nLa taxe sur la valeur ajoutée ou TVA est un impôt indirect. Elle est calculée sur le prix de vente hors taxes de tous les biens et services. Mais \"son taux varie d'un produit à l'autre\", écrit le ministère de l'Economie.\n\nLe taux de 20% \"s'applique à la plupart des ventes de biens et des prestations de services\". Toutefois il existe également des taux réduits sur d'autres types de transactions, détaille le ministère sur son site :\n\n(Capture d'écran du site de Bercy le 17 juin 2020)\n\nSelon cette note de l'Insee de février 2019, \"la part de la TVA acquittée dépend du niveau de vie, les 10 % des personnes les plus modestes consacrent 12 % de leur revenu disponible à cette taxe, contre 5 % pour les 10 % les plus aisées\".\n\nComme le souligne Le Monde, des \"dépenses importantes, comme la plupart des locations de logement et une partie des achats de logement, en sont totalement exonérées\".\n\n\"En France, on est plus proche d’un taux moyen de TVA de 14 à 15 %\", selon Gaelle Menu Lejeune. Elle ajoute que \"le pouvoir d'achat réel ne se mesure par hors taxe\", après application de la TVA.\n\nPour l'Etat... mais pas seulement\n\nUne partie de ces prélèvements (l'impôt sur le revenu et la TVA) serviront effectivement à payer des dépenses de l'Etat, pour financer la construction des routes, des hopitaux ou les fonctionnaires d’Etat, par exemple.\n\nMais une partie \"conséquente\" des cotisations salariales et patronales vont être redistribuées sous forme de prestations sociales, expliquent les deux expertes interrogées.\n\n\"Cet argent sert notamment à financer les retraites, le chômage partiel, notre système de soins et de santé par exemple. C'est ce qui permet et finance le niveau de protection sociale au sens large en France\", relève Gaelle Menu Lejeune.",

          "text": "L'OMS n'a pas admis que le futur éventuel vaccin contre le Covid ne marcherait pas\n\nUne publication partagée au moins 1.800 fois sur Facebook depuis le 13 juin prétend que l'OMS \"admet par inadvertance que les vaccinations ne fonctionneront pas contre le coronavirus\". C'est faux: non seulement, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé n'a pas dit cela mais le texte se fonde sur un contresens quant à la façon dont fonctionne la vaccination.\n\nCe texte, publié le 13 juin sur le site Cogiito.com, qui a déjà publié de fausses affirmations sur les vaccins comme celle-ci, vérifiée par l'AFP- a été partagé au moins 1.800 fois sur des groupes et pages Facebook, selon l'outil de mesure d'audience des réseaux sociaux Crowdtangle.\n\nEcrit dans un français parfois approximatif, le texte est en fait la traduction via le logiciel Google Traduction de cet article, publié un mois plus tôt, le 18 mai, par le site américain Naturalnews.com, qui a déjà publié des affirmations erronées par le passé, également vérifiées par l'AFP (1, 2).\n\nMontage de captures d'écran faites le 18 juin 2020\n\nLe nombre de décès mentionnés dans le texte -\"310.000\"- est d'ailleurs reproduit tel quel dans la version française, sans mise à jour. Au 13 juin, le Covid-19 avait tué plus de 425.000 personnes selon un décompte de l'AFP basé sur des chiffres officiels. Au 18 juin, le bilan provisoire à 16h15 GMT était de plus de 450.000 morts.\n\nL'OMS ne dit pas cela\n\nPour étayer son propos, le texte renvoie vers un article (en anglais) de la chaîne France24, reprenant une dépêche de l'AFP du 25 avril. On peut y lire des déclarations faites par l'OMS à propos de la question de l'immunité des personnes infectées par le Covid-19. Des propos relayés plus en détails par l'AFP ici en anglais, et là en français.\n\nCe que disait l'OMS en avril, c'est qu'il \"n'y a actuellement aucune preuve que les personnes qui se sont remises du Covid-19 et qui ont des anticorps soient prémunies contre une seconde infection\". Autrement dit, on ne sait pas si une personne infectée crée une immunité qui l'empêcherait d'être réinfectée.\n\nDes citations que l'on retrouve dans ce communiqué daté du 24 avril, qui ne concernait pas la question des vaccins.\n\nD'où l'importance, soulignée régulièrement par l'OMS, de respecter les mesures barrière et de poursuivre ardemment la recherche de traitement et de vaccin accessibles à tous.\n\n(AFP / Fabrice Coffrini)\n\nAu 18 juin 2020, il n'existe ni de traitement validé, ni de vaccin, et l'on ne sait toujours pas avec certitude si les personnes infectées sont immmunisées contre une nouvelle infection, et si elles le sont, pour combien de temps.\n\nL'article déduit des propos de l'OMS que cette dernière a exclu la possibilité d'une \"immunité naturelle\" contre le nouveau coronavirus. Son interprétation est erronée.\n\nImmunité naturelle contre immunité vaccinale, un contresens\n\nIl enchaîne sur cette question rhétorique : \"Si l’immunité naturelle est hors de question, alors pourquoi l’immunité induite par le vaccin serait-elle meilleure ?\"\n\nL'auteur du texte surenchérit un peu plus loin: \"si notre propre système immunitaire naturel ne peut pas lutter contre la chose, alors il n’y a aucun moyen qu’un vaccin fasse autre chose que des effets indésirables inutiles\" (sic).\n\nMais cette affirmation méconnaît le principe même de la vaccination, qui justement \"consiste à protéger un individu contre une maladie en stimulant son système immunitaire\", comme l'Inserm l'explique sur son site.\n\nC'est donc précisément parce que le système immunitaire du corps humain peut se retrouver impuissant à lutter contre une maladie que le vaccin est conçu pour faire \"mieux\" que lui.\n\n\"Lorsque nous rencontrons un microbe et tombons malade, notre système immunitaire se défend en fabricant des anticorps, destinés à neutraliser et éliminer ce microbe\", explique le site officiel français vaccination-info-service.fr.\n\n\"La vaccination fonctionne de la même manière, tout en évitant les dangers liés à la maladie. Lorsque nous recevons un vaccin, un microbe rendu inoffensif est introduit dans notre corps\", est-il aussi expliqué.\n\nLe vaccin \"ne nous rend pas malade, mais notre système immunitaire fabrique quand même des anticorps pour le neutraliser et l’éliminer. Si nous rencontrons un jour le vrai microbe, notre système immunitaire le reconnaîtra tout de suite et l’éliminera avant qu’il ne puisse nous rendre malade\", peut-on encore lire sur le site.\n\nOn peut aussi voir dans cette vidéographie de l'AFP le principe de fonctionnement de la vaccination.\n\nLes effets indésirables, réels mais très rares\n\nLes effets indésirables liés aux vaccins existent mais sont extrêmement rares et en général sans gravité, comme expliqué par l'AFP notamment ici.\n\nComme en atteste une abondante littérature scientifique, \"le risque de développer une maladie grave en ne se vaccinant pas est beaucoup plus important que celui de voir apparaître un effet indésirable lié à la vaccination\", comme le dit le site vaccination-info-service, qui ajoute que \"la plupart des réactions vaccinales sont mineures et passagères, et les éventuels effets indésirables des vaccins sont très surveillés\".\n\nLa sécurité des vaccins est en outre surveillée de près par l'OMS, qui recense et étudie tout effet indésirable survenu après l'administration d'un vaccin, mais aussi par les autorités nationales.\n\nL'OMS explique que \"les vaccins efficaces (c.-à-d. les vaccins qui induisent une immunité protectrice) peuvent être à l’origine de certains effets secondaires indésirables qui, le plus souvent, sont bénins et disparaissent rapidement\".\n\nPar exemple, les vaccins peuvent entraîner des réactions allergiques à l'un des produits qu'ils contiennent, comme expliqué par la Revue médicale suisse ou dans ce document de l'Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris et de l'Inserm.\n\nAutre point souligné par l'OMS, un effet indésirable survenu après un vaccin n'est pas forcément causé par celui-ci.\n\n\"La majorité des manifestations que l’on pense liées à l’administration d’un vaccin ne sont en réalité pas dues au vaccin lui-même – beaucoup sont simplement des évènements fortuits qui se produisent par pure coïncidence, d’autres (notamment dans les pays en développement) sont dues à des erreurs, humaines ou programmatiques\", précise encore l'OMS.\n\nBill Gates, cible régulière des antivaccins\n\nLe texte relaie ensuite des théories complotistes autour de Bill Gates, cible favorite des antivaccins parce qu'il finance via sa Fondation des campagnes de vaccination.\n\nPlusieurs affirmations infondées contre le milliardaire (l'accusant de vouloir profiter de la pandémie pour vacciner de force la population et pucer l'humanité etc...) ou de prôner une réduction de la population mondiale ont été démontées par l'AFP.\n\nDes vaccins ont bien permis d'éradiquer de nombreuses maladies\n\nLa fin du texte laisse également entendre que les vaccins sont de toutes façon inutiles, puisqu'il \"existe déjà des vaccins pour d’autres problèmes de santé comme la rougeole qui n’ont pas été éradiqués\".\n\nL'efficacité des vaccins dans la lutte contre les maladies infectieuses fait pourtant l'objet d'un consensus scientifique.\n\nOn peut voir ci-dessous les effets de la vaccination en France.\n\nCapture d'écran du site Vaccination info service faite le 18 juin 2020\n\nLes vaccins ont très clairement montré leur efficacité, souligne auprès de l'AFP le Dr Julian Leibowitz, du Texas A&M College of Medicine, aux Etats-Unis, citant par exemple le \"succès\" du vaccin contre la rougeole ou rappelant que \"le vaccin contre la polio a quasiment éradiqué la poliomyélite\".\n\nAprès une campagne de vaccination massive, l'OMS déclarait en mai 1980, que \"tous les peuples\" étaient \"libérés de la variole\", une maladie infectieuse d'origine virale touchant essentiellement les enfants, comme raconté dans cette dépêche AFP du 18 mai 2020.\n\nQuant à la rougeole, maladie virale extrêmement contagieuse qui touche surtout les enfants et qui \"peut entraîner de graves complications, notamment une cécité, une encéphalite, une diarrhée sévère, une infection auriculaire ou une pneumonie\", elle n'est, en effet, pas éradiquée à l'échelle du monde entier.\n\nMais l'OMS estime qu'entre 2000 et 2016, la vaccination contre la rougeole a permis d'éviter plus de 20 millions de décès.\n\nCependant, \"les objectifs d’élimination de la rougeole pour 2015 n’avaient pas été atteints en raison de la persistance des lacunes en matière de couverture vaccinale\", ajoutait l'OMS fin 2019.\n\nUne écolière se fait vacciner contre la rougeole et la rubéole en Inde en 2018 (AFP / Biju BORO)\n\nEt le virus a connu des flambées dans plusieurs pays, y compris en Europe et aux Etats-Unis depuis 2018, mais aussi aux îles Samoa, qui ont dû vacciner en urgence la population fin 2019.\n\nAu total, 142.000 personnes en sont mortes dans le monde en 2018, surtout en Afrique sub-saharienne, la RDC étant particulièrement touchée. C'était quatre fois moins qu'en 2000, mais en hausse de 15% par rapport à 2017.",

          "text": "An image shared on Facebook purportedly shows a “Fight to Win” banner that China recently set up in the Indian-controlled territory of Ladakh in Kashmir.\n\nVerdict: False\n\nThe photo is more than 7 years old, and the banner was put up by Indian military personnel.\n\nFact Check:\n\nSocial media users shared the photo of the “Fight to Win” banner amid recent tensions along the China-India border in the disputed Ladakh region. Thousands of soldiers from China and India have faced off with each other in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley in recent weeks, with at least 20 Indian soldiers dying in a June 16 confrontation, BBC News reported.\n\nThe image’s Facebook caption, which vaguely mimics the style of a breaking news alert, alleges that recently “China #installed this banner in #Ladakh.” The photo has also been shared on Twitter with similar claims.

Ladakh, sharing borders with both China and Pakistan, has seen an increase in tourism over the last few years, an alternative to Nepali Himalayan treks.”",

Biden Is Trying To Explain Why He Created Laws That Charged Blacks Harsher For Crack Than Whites For Cocaine. pic.twitter.com/pKWlX0LqP9 — Nas (@nasescobar316) May 24, 2020\n\nVerdict: False\n\nThe clip has been selectively edited to remove key context and misrepresents what Biden said. He was criticizing the sentencing disparities in a crime bill.\n\nFact Check:\n\nThe video, which comes from a May 2019 campaign stop in New Hampshire, resurfaced on Facebook and Twitter recently, accompanied by claims that it shows Biden using race to justify a disparity in sentencing for crack and cocaine. For instance, Twitter user @nasescobar316 suggested Biden said that “someone (black) doing crack was fundamentally different than someone (white) sniffing cocaine” in a different neighborhood.\n\nBiden has faced criticism for his role in helping pass the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which has been largely criticized for causing incarceration rates to spike, according to Vox. He also helped craft a 1986 bill that has been blamed for creating a disparity in sentencing for crack and cocaine and disproportionately affecting black people, the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe video has been selectively edited. It misrepresents what Biden said and leaves out key context surrounding the remark. (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Making A Racist Remark)\n\nIn the Facebook live stream from ABC News showing his full speech, Biden appears to actually be condemning parts of the crime bill he helped craft. He also explains that some people claimed the drugs were “fundamentally different,” not that he believed it.\n\n“The big mistake in the crime bill on drugs was one that [former Democratic New York Sen.] Pat Moynihan, and he’s a great guy, you remember the crack epidemic came from the Bahamas,” Biden said, per the live stream. “And we were told by medical doctors at the time that because it permeated the membrane of the brain more quickly, it was the crack you never come back. It was somehow fundamentally different than someone in a beautiful neighborhood like this sniffing a line of cocaine would get not automatic sentence for.”\n\nThe clip being shared on social media also leaves out the key context of Biden saying immediately after that he has been trying to change that measure of the bill. (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Bernie Sanders Making Racist Remarks In Front Of Schoolchildren)\n\n“I’ve been trying to change that since it passed. Every single year as senator, as well as vice president to the president. And as vice president to the President of the United States with Barack Obama, we let – nobody should be in jail in my view,” Biden said. “Nobody should be in jail for a crime that’s not a crime of violence.”\n\nBiden previously discussed this part of his crime bill at a National Action Network event in January 2019.\n\n“It was a big mistake when it was made,” Biden said, referring to the provision that created the sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine. “We were told by experts that crack, you never go back, it was somehow fundamentally different. It is not different. But it has trapped an entire generation.”\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",

His lawyer has also refuted the claim.\n\nFact Check:\n\nGugino attended a June 4 protest against police brutality in Buffalo, New York, where he was shoved by two police officers, causing him to fall backward and hit his head on the ground, according to video of the incident.\n\nIn recent weeks, some social media users, including President Donald Trump, have made dubious claims about Gugino. This particular post alleges that he has been arrested 300 times, including 82 arrests for incitement. The image appears to show Gugino in handcuffs being escorted away by a police officer.\n\n“This is the ‘kindly old man’ who was ‘pushed’ in Buffalo,” text above the image reads. “Mr. Gugino had been previously arrested 300 times. 82 times for incitement. Riots is what he does for a living.”\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any evidence that Gugino had been arrested 300 times. His lawyer, Kelly V. Zarcone, refuted the claim in an email to the DCNF.\n\n“It is false,” Zarcone said in an email. “He was arrested 4 times for peacefully protesting and never convicted of anything. In fact, 3 of the 4 arrests did not even result in any charges against him.”\n\nGugino detailed the four times he said he’s been arrested on his personal blog: in Orange County, California, in 2009, near the White House in 2012 and 2013 and near the Capitol in 2016. The DCNF confirmed each of those arrests occurred.\n\nThe first arrest appears to have involved an unnamed misdemeanor that occurred in Orange County, California in 2009, according to records obtained by the DCNF. PolitiFact reported Gugino was found not guilty of a misdemeanor charge for trespassing.\n\nNo public records could be obtained for the 2012 incident, but it appears to be the one photographed in the post. A reverse image search of the photo revealed it was taken by filmmaker Justin Norman in January, 2012, and can be found on Norman’s Flickr page.\n\n“Martin Gugino is arrested for peacefully protesting against the Guantánamo detention center in front of the White House,” the caption said. (RELATED: Were 2 Hospitals Set On Fire During George Floyd Protests In Columbus, Ohio?)\n\nHe was arrested again in 2013 by the U.S. Park Police, which falls under National Park Service’s jurisdiction. This time he was arrested for “demonstrating without a permit,” according to an email from Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, a public information officer for the Park Police.\n\nThe fourth arrest Gugino mentions on his blog occurred in January 2016 when he was arrested with about 30 other people by Capitol Police for “unlawful demonstration activities near the Rotunda steps of the U.S. Capitol Building,” according to an emailed statement from the Capitol Police.\n\nThe DCNF also searched Google, LexisNexis and online databases but found no record of any other arrests. PACER, a database of case and docket information for federal courts, also had no results, according to PolitiFact.\n\nGugino suffered a fractured skull and is unable to walk, CNN reported on June 16.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office confirmed the letter is fake.\n\nFact Check:\n\nThe letter, which appears to bear the official U.K. government letterhead and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s signature, informs recipients of a proposed policy that would require all residents to receive a radio frequency identification (RFID) microchip starting in 2021. Such implants would be provided and inserted for free through the National Health Service (NHS), according to the letter.\n\n“In a world where we face issues of terrorism, crime and cyber fraud, the RFID microchips will enable law enforcement agencies to track the movements of criminals and terrorists,” the alleged letter continues. “It will also hold a unique personal identification number, that once scanned, will allow law enforcement to identify whether that person is: wanted for a crime, an illegal immigrant or a terrorist sympathiser etc.”\n\nBut the Daily Caller found no evidence of the letter or such a proposal existing. Had Johnson sent the letter, media outlets would have reported on it, yet none have. A press conference and a speech were uploaded to the U.K. government website on June 9, the same day the alleged letter was dated, but neither of them mention RFID microchips. A search of the NHS website also yielded no results regarding implantation of microchips.\n\nA closer inspection of the letter revealed a discrepancy that further adds to its dubiousness.

The claim appears to stem from a misinterpretation of an NPR article encouraging people to read more literature from non-white authors.\n\nFact Check:\n\nThe Facebook post contains a screen grab of the website Trending Right Wing’s June 9 article that puts up the headline “NPR Wants People to Burn Books Written By ‘White People.'” The featured image in the article shows masked people gathered something burning on the ground.\n\n“Not only do liberals want to burn down police stations, dollar stores, and upscale shopping malls, they want to torch each and every book written by ‘white people,'” the article says. “Don’t use coal to heat your home, that’s not green enough. Instead, throw a few Ray Bradbury novels on the fire and you’ll soon be up to a toasty 451 degrees Fahrenheit.”\n\nThe article repeats the phrase “decolonizing your bookshelf” multiple times, seemingly referencing an NPR story published on June 6, titled “Your Bookshelf May Be Part of the Problem,” that uses a nearly identical expression.\n\nHowever, at no point does the NPR story call for book burning, nor does it suggest people should not read the works of white authors. Instead, it encourages people to examine the contents of their bookshelves and expand their reading to include books written by more diverse authors.\n\n“Reading broadly and with intention is how we counter dehumanization and demand visibility, effectively bridging the gap between what we read and how we might live in a more just and equitable society,” wrote Juan Vidal, the author of the piece. “As a Latino, I’ve had non-Latino friends ask me to recommend Latin American authors and novels. This is fine, and welcomed. But if all I have to offer the curious-minded is literature that comes from people who look like me, speak my language, or come from where I come from, that’s a problem.\n\nA Trending Right Wing spokesperson told The Associated Press that the article “caricatures” the NPR piece, saying, “The article makes it quite clear that the ‘burning’ is not literal.” But that intention does not appear to have come across to all readers. The screen grab being shared on Facebook only shows the headline, which does not accurately describe the contents of the NPR story.\n\n“NPR stands by this piece which encourages people to read more and from a variety of sources, rather than less,” Isabel Lara, executive director of media relations at NPR, told The Associated Press.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The previous day, he had signed an executive order that includes incentivizing police departments to meet higher standards for the use of force and de-escalation training. The executive order comes amid nationwide protests against police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nDuring the “Hannity” interview, Trump claimed that “the previous administration, and, frankly, many administrations, they did nothing on this” in regards to police reform. But that is incorrect, as the Obama administration attempted to address police misconduct in a number of ways. (RELATED: Does Joe Biden Support Defunding The Police, As Donald Trump Claims?)\n\nFollowing the 2014 killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, the Obama administration created the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing that sought to “strengthen public trust and foster strong relationships between local law enforcement and the communities they protect, while also promoting effective crime reduction,” according to a White House fact sheet. The task force, which New York University School of Law Policing Project Director Barry Friedman described as “one of the most far-reaching examinations since the 1960s,” put out a comprehensive list of recommendations on how to improve policing in its 2015 final report, per The New York Times.\n\nObama also signed an executive order in 2015 that placed new limits on the transfer of surplus military gear to law enforcement agencies. That executive order banned the transfer of certain military equipment, including grenade launchers, tracked armored vehicles, bayonets and guns and ammunition of .50 caliber or higher, according to The Hill. Trump rescinded the executive order in 2017.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the Justice Department conducted “pattern or practice” investigations of 25 police departments and enforced 14 consent decrees mandating reforms, according to a press release from early January 2017. The Trump administration has curtailed the use of “pattern or practice” investigations and consent decrees, per The Washington Post.\n\nThe Obama-era Justice Department also awarded grants totaling more than $23.2 million to law enforcement agencies around the country to expand the use of body cameras, according to a press release.

In this case, a Facebook post makes a dubious claim about the nomenclature for the disease caused by the new coronavirus: that the acronym “COVID” in COVID-19 stands for “Certificate Of Vaccination Identification.”\n\nThat is incorrect. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Feb. 11 that COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease 2019,” with the number “19” referring to the year the virus was first detected.

Hispanics comprise the largest ethnic group to receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (37 percent). — Geoff Bennett (@GeoffRBennett) October 11, 2018\n\n“Whites make up the largest share of those receiving food stamps (36 percent) and Medicaid (43 percent),” he tweeted Oct. 11. “Hispanics comprise the largest ethnic group to receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (37 percent).”\n\nVerdict: True\n\nWhites make up the largest share of food stamps and Medicaid recipients, but as a share of the U.S. population, they utilize proportionally less than other ethnic groups.\n\nFact Check:\n\nBennett was responding to comments made by rapper Kanye West in the Oval Office, where he said that many black people vote for the Democratic Party because of welfare programs.\n\n“Kanye West’s comments today about African Americans and welfare were as objectively false as they were dangerous in perpetuating stereotypes that position low-income blacks as the face of America’s welfare system,” Bennett tweeted.\n\nHis figure for recipients of food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Non-Hispanic whites made up 36.2 percent of the 44 million people who used SNAP in fiscal year 2016 – the largest share of any ethnic group.\n\nNon-Hispanic whites, however, accounted for 61 percent of the U.S. population in 2016, so they utilized food stamps proportionally less than their share of the population. Blacks made up 12 percent of the population, but 25.6 percent of all recipients in 2016. Hispanics accounted for 18 percent of the population and 17.2 percent of all recipients.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) provides statistics on non-elderly Medicaid recipients using data from the Census Bureau. It found that blacks were more proportionate in their usage of Medicaid, making up 18 percent of non-elderly recipients in 2016. Whites made up the largest share – 43 percent of all recipients – while Hispanics accounted for 30 percent.\n\nFor the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Bennett was correct that the largest share of its 2.8 million recipients in FY 2016 – 36.9 percent – were Hispanic. Black Americans made up 29.1 percent of all recipients and whites made up 27.6 percent.\n\nPew Research Center found that blacks are more likely than other ethnic groups to have received benefits at one point in their lives. In a 2012 survey, 64 percent of blacks, 56 percent of whites and 50 percent of Hispanics said they had used at least one of six entitlement benefits, including Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP and Social Security.\n\nThese stats line up with higher rates of poverty and food insecurity in the black and Hispanic communities. KFF estimates that 22 percent of blacks and 20 percent of Hispanics were in poverty in 2016, compared to just 9 percent of whites. For food insecurity, the USDA reports that 22.5 percent of black households, 18.5 percent of Hispanic households and 9.3 percent of non-Hispanic white households did not always have access to enough nutritious food in 2016.\n\nFollow Shane on Twitter\n\nHave a fact check suggestion?

The organizations mentioned in the article have been linked to conspiracy theories in the past.\n\nFact Check:\n\nThe article, published by the website NBCM News, alleges that the queen and husband Prince Philip were found guilty in 2013 by “six judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice” in the Belgian capital of Brussels.\n\n“After nearly a year of litigation, Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Phillip, were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops residential school in British Columbia,” the article alleged. “Grieving parents haven’t seen their children since they left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct. 10 1964.”\n\nBut there is no truth to the article’s claim. The British royal family often makes headlines. If the queen had been found guilty of such a crime, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it, and Buckingham Palace has not issued a press release.\n\nCloser examination of the article reveals other red flags that add to its dubiousness.

          "text": "[오카다 나오키/일본 관방 부장관 (지난 15일) : 일본 정부로서는 세계문화유산위원회의 결의, 권고를 성실히 이행하고 있다고 생각합니다.][기자]세계문화유산으로 등재된 '군함도' 등을 홍보하는 일본의 '산업 유산 정보센터'가 최근 문을 열었죠.강제 동원 역사도 같이 밝히겠다는 약속은 지켜지지 않았고, 왜곡·미화 논란을 키우고 있습니다.아예 세계유산 등재 취소가 가능할지 따져봤습니다.[앵커]이가혁 기자, 한번 세계유산으로 등재가 된 걸, 다시 취소할 수가 있습니까?[기자]가능합니다. 유네스코 운영지침에 등재 취소 조건이 나와 있습니다.116항, 192항인데요.'등재 신청국이 등재 당시 제안한 시정조치가 기한 내에 이행되지 않은 경우, 위원회는 등재 목록에서 삭제를 검토'합니다.'시정 조치가 권고사항이라 강제하기 어렵다'는 보도도 있지만, 유네스코 결정은 본질적으로 모두 권고입니다.아주 똑같은 전례는 없지만, 결국 위원국들이 일본의 이행상황을 어떻게 판단하는지에 따라 취소 가능성이 달라진다고 할 수 있습니다.[앵커]결국 다른 나라 의중도 중요한 건데, 일본이 등재 결정 당시에 '역사적 사실을 숨김없이 알리겠다'고 공개적으로 밝혔잖아요.[기자]밝힌 바 있습니다. 보도도 나왔는데요. 2015년 7월 회의 석상에서 일본 측 대표가 \"일본 정부의 강제동원과 강제노동, 인권침해 사실을 인정하고 정보센터를 지어 알리겠다\"고 밝혔습니다.[앵커]이걸 어기면 취소 사유가 된다, 이런 거군요?[기자]그렇습니다. 이 약속은 유네스코가 '등재 여부'와 '지속 여부'를 결정하는 권고에 포함된 내용입니다.'조건부' 등재인 겁니다.이 약속이 어떻게 도출되고 또 국제 사회가 어떻게 받아들여졌는지, 당시 회의 영상을 저희가 직접 확인하고 정리했습니다. 보시죠.[세계유산위원회 자문기구 : 각 장소의 전체 역사를 이해할 수 있게 할 것][세계유산위원회 위원장 : 일본의 성명이 속기록으로 제공돼 위원회 결정의 일부가 될 것][세계유산위원회 보고자 : '전체 역사를 이해할 수 있게 한다'는 것에 관해 일본의 성명에 주목한다][독일 대표단 : 모든 위원국들은 일본의 성명과 관련지어 결정하길…][일본 대표단 : 더 구체적으로는 다음을 알릴 것… 강제동원·강제노동·가혹한 조건]저희가 길지만, 꼼꼼하게 보여드린 게 보신 것처럼, 일본이 강제노동 역사를 정확히 알리는 게 당시 합의된 표결 전 '등재조건'이라는 것을 말씀드리기 위해서 입니다.의장국인 독일이 결정문 수정안을 마련하고, 일본의 성명 내용을 표결 사항에 포함시켰습니다.일본은 강제동원 역사를 인정하는 성명서를 사전에 나눠주고, 이걸 다른 나라가 모두 읽고 통과시켰습니다.왜곡을 멈추지 않으면, 이런 국제회의 결정 자체를 일본이 번복하는 게 됩니다.등재 취소사유로 볼 여지가 충분합니다.[앵커]그럼 유네스코 입장은 어떤가요?[기자]저희가 이미 사흘 전, 유네스코 본부와 세계유산위원회 등에 이메일 질의를 보냈지만 답변이 오지 않았습니다.딱 한 군데 세계유산위원회 자문기구에서 답변이 왔는데, \"공식적인 답변을 할 수 없다\"고만 입장을 밝혔습니다.다만, 유네스코는 지난 2018년 결정문에서 일본에 '권고사항을 더 충실히 이행하라'고 촉구했습니다.일본 대표는 \"강제동원을 알리겠다는 약속을 진심을 담아 지켜나갈 것\"이라고 또 약속했습니다.정작 일본이 회의장 밖에서 한 말은 늘 달랐습니다.기록을 좀 보면 \"강제 노동 인정한 건 아니다\", \"특정한 문구에 과도한 관심 두지 말아야한다\" 이런 말을 했습니다.이번이 일본이 문을 연 정보 센터 전시 내용을 보면, 이런 말을 보면 약속을 지킬 의지가 없다는 게 확실히 드러나고 있습니다.[앵커]그러게요. 앞으로, 등재 취소 논의가 나올지 좀 지켜봐야겠군요. 그런데 오늘(17일) 마치기 전에 할 얘기가 있다면서요. 오늘 팩트체크 1000회째죠?[기자]네, 1000회입니다. 2014년 9월 22일, 첫 방송을 시작했습니다.과거 장면들 좀 모아봤는데요.이후 5년 9개월 동안 총 오늘까지 1000개의 사안을 검증했습니다.국내 유일 국제팩트체킹네트워크(IFCN) 인증사로서, 앞으로 더욱더 노력하겠습니다.[앵커]네, 기대하겠습니다. 팩트체크 이가혁 기자였습니다.※JTBC 팩트체크는 국내 유일 국제팩트체킹네트워크(IFCN) 인증사입니다.",

          "text": "[앵커]바로 팩트체크 이가혁 기자와 몇 가지 따져보겠습니다.이 기자, 풍선이 아니라 드론으로 평양에 전단을 날렸다는 얘기도 지금 구체적으로 나오고 있는 거죠?[기자]대북전단 활동을 가장 적극적으로 하고 있는 자유북한운동연합이 언론을 통해서 여러 차례 주장한 내용입니다.\"4월 9일 밤에 파주에서 드론 1대를 날려서 평양에 대북전단 1만여 장을 살포했다\", 또 이 단체 대표는 \"앞으로도 드론으로 더 많이 보낼 것이다\" 이렇게 밝혔습니다.[앵커]다른 것 다 떠나서 휴전선 가까운 지역에서 드론을 날리면 그 자체가 위법 아닌가요?[기자]그렇습니다. 드론은 항공안전법으로 규제를 받고 있습니다.동호회분들 다 익숙하실 텐데요.지역 안전과 군사 보안 등을 이유로 비행금지구역이 설정돼 있는데, 경기도 파주시는 가장 남쪽인 산남동 일부를 제외한 거의 모든 지역이 금지구역에 해당합니다.따로 군 당국 승인을 받지 않는 이상 함부로 드론을 띄워서는 안 됩니다.또 해가 지고 난 후부터 해뜨기 전까지 '야간 비행'은 기본적으로 지역 구분 없이 무조건 금지입니다.이 단체가 대북전달 살포에 드론을 사용하겠다는 계획을 밝힌 게 지난 2015년입니다.당시에도 통일부 당국자는 \"무인기 활용한 대북전단 살포행위는 항공법 등 현행법 저촉\"이라고 밝힌 바 있습니다.[앵커]정말로 파주에서 평양까지 드론을 이용해서 전단을 날릴 수 있느냐, 의문이 드는데 검증을 해보니 어떻습니까?[기자]단체 측의 주장을 뒷받침할 영상이나 사진이 있으면 그걸 근거로 할 텐데, 이런 게 공개된 것이 없습니다.확인을 위해서 박상학 대표에게 수 차례 연락했지만, 닿지 않았습니다.처음 박 대표의 주장이 나왔을 때 합동참모본부 관계자는 언론에 \"최근 휴전선 일대에서 무인기 비행 궤적이 확인된 바 없다\"고 밝혔습니다.대신 여러 전문가를 통해서 기술적인 가능성을 따져봤습니다.파주에서 평양까지 직선거리 165km입니다.흔히 취미용 또는 방송용 드론으로 익숙한 회전익은 배터리나 연료 지속시간을 고려할 때 이 정도 비행은 불가능합니다.상대적으로 장시간 비행이 가능한 비행기와 비슷한 모양의 고정익으로는 기술적으로는 가능합니다.다만, 단체 측이 언론 인터뷰에서 '20kg 상당 화물을 실을 수 있는 드론' 정도의 정보는 밝혔는데, 이 정도 무게를 버티려면 고정익 동체 크기가 레이더에 안 걸리기 어려운 정도, 그러니까 크기가 어느 정도 있을 것이라는 게 전문가들의 판단입니다.현재까지 드러난 정보만 가지고 판단하면 대북전단을 실은 드론이 실제 평양까지 갔을 가능성은 낮은 상황입니다.[앵커]잘 들었습니다. 팩트체크 이가혁 기자였습니다.※JTBC 팩트체크는 국내 유일 국제팩트체킹네트워크(IFCN) 인증사입니다.",

          "text": "[기자]학대로 숨진 9살 A군, A군 아버지와 동거인은 이미 한 달 전 아동학대 신고가 접수돼 수사를 받던 상황이었습니다.하지만 사망에 이르는 끔찍한 학대가 또 벌어졌습니다.무엇이 문제였을지, 긴급 팩트체크했습니다.[앵커]이가혁 기자, 먼저 시간 순서대로 사실관계를 좀 따져볼까요?[기자]5월 5일 어린이날이었습니다.A군은 천안의 한 대학병원 응급실에서 머리 상처를 치료하고 돌아갑니다.그리고 이틀 뒤인 7일, 멍 자국 등을 의심한 응급실 의료진이 경찰에 아동학대 의심 신고를 합니다.또 하루 뒤, 천안 서북경찰서는 충남아동보호전문기관에 조사를 의뢰합니다.전문기관이 A군 집을 방문한 건, 또 그 닷새 뒤인 13일이었습니다.A군의 작년 담임교사 면담도 이뤄졌습니다.우선 여기까지의 과정이 '즉시 신고, 즉시 조사'라는 원칙에 충실했는지, 조금씩 이렇게 시간이 늦어지는 사이에 범죄 흔적이 가려진 건 아닌지, 점검이 필요한 대목입니다.그리고 5월 18일, 기관은 경찰에 '아동학대 사건 정보 공유회신서'를 보냅니다.A군과 부모를 분리할 필요는 없지만, 학대 재발을 막을 수 있게 그런 방법을 지원한다, '가정 기능 강화'라는 결론을 공식 통보합니다.[앵커]그러니까 바로 그 부분이 문제로 꼽히죠. 왜 피해 아동을 분리를 안 했냐, 왜 그랬다고 합니까?[기자]일단 법이 없는 건 아닙니다.법률에는 학대 가해자와 아동을 격리하거나, 보호시설로 인도하게 돼 있습니다.다만, 그런 긴급한 보호 필요성이 있는지는 경찰과 전문기관이 종합적으로 판단합니다.A군을 담당했던 경찰서와 아동보호전문기관은 '피해 아동 본인의 의사와 지난해 학교생활, 부모의 반응' 등을 종합적으로 고려해서 판단했다고 저희 취재진에 밝혔습니다.하지만, 결과적으로 이런 참사를 예측하고 막는데 실패했습니다.[앵커]그때 판단이 옳았는지, 기준상의 문제가 있는지는 별도로 조사를 해봐야 알 것 같군요. 그 이후에 피해 아동의 부친과 동거인이 조사를 받았잖아요?[기자]경찰은 앞서 말씀드린 아동보호전문기관의 1차 조사 결과를 바탕으로, 지난 5월 21일, 24일 두 차례 아동학대 혐의로 두 사람을 불러 조사했습니다.여기서 '지난해 10월부터 5월까지 아동학대 혐의'가 확인됐지만, 따로 분리해 보호할 정도는 아니라는 결론, 바뀌지 않습니다.그리고 1주일 뒤, A군이 가방 속에 갇혀 심정지 상태로 병원에 실려 갈 때까지 첫 가정 조사 이후에 약 20일간 관계기관의 누구도, 다시 가정방문을 하거나 A군의 상황을 직접 확인하지는 않았습니다.이번 사건에서 가장 큰 문제는 관계기관의 첫 판단이 어긋나고 나니까, 다시 돌이킬 수 있는 방법이 없었다는 겁니다.심지어 최초 가정방문 때 A군의 부친과 동거인은 조사관에게 \"필요하면 도움 요청하겠다\"고 밝히고, 학대를 이어갔습니다.아동복지법에 따르면, 상담·교육 및 심리적 치료 등 지원은 권고 사항일 뿐이기 때문입니다.앞서 쭉 보신대로, A군의 아동학대 피해사실은 이미 5월 초에 발견됐지만, 정작 현장에서 시스템이 제대로 작동하지 않았습니다.올초에 아동학대를 막는 강화된 법이 만들어져서 이제 10월부터 시행됩니다.시행 전에, 반드시 재점검이 필요합니다.[앵커]아이를 구할 수 있는 기회가 있었던 건지도 모르겠네요. 팩트체크 이가혁 기자였습니다.※JTBC 팩트체크는 국내 유일 국제팩트체킹네트워크(IFCN) 인증사입니다.",

'어떻게 처리해야 되는 거냐?' 확인해 달라는 요청이 많았습니다.[앵커]이가혁 기자, 애초에 주차스티커 문제로 시비가 있었던 걸로 파악이 되고 있죠?[기자]그렇습니다. 평택경찰서가 오늘 오전에 차주를 불러서 조사를 했습니다.사건이 발생한 지난 1일은, 이 아파트가 5월 한 달 동안 입주민 대상으로 주차스티커 발급을 마치고 이제부터는 스티커가 있어야만 들어갈 수 있습니다, 이렇게 이 제도를 시행한 첫날이었다고 합니다.그런데 문제의 차는 스티커를 발급 받지 않은 상태로 주차장에 들어가려고 했고 아파트관리직원과 차주 사이에 옥신각신이 있었다고 합니다.화가 난 차주가 그냥 이렇게 차를 두고 가버린 겁니다.또 분노한 다른 주민들이 차 앞뒤를 이렇게 막아버리기도 했습니다.[앵커]그러니까 14시간이 지나서야 차주가 다시 나타났다고 하잖아요. 그런데 이런 경우에 불법주차 단속을 하는 지자체가 강제로 견인해 가거나 할 수는 없는 겁니까?[기자]불가능합니다. 만약에 이 상황이요.일반 도로에서 벌어졌다면 주차단속을 평소에 하는 관할 지자체가 와서 불법주차 딱지도 끊고 강제 견인도 가능하겠죠.하지만 아파트 단지 안은 도로교통법상 불법주차단속 장소가 아닌 사유지로 분류가 되기 때문입니다.아니면 지자체가 무단 방치 차량으로 접수해서 견인하면 안 되냐 이런 의견도 올라와 있었는데, 이건 차주에게 경고문을 발송하고 그래도 20일 넘게 아무 조치를 안 하는 이런 사전 요건이 있어서 이번 경우에는 맞지 않습니다.또 그래도 혹시 가능한 조치가 있는지 없는지 여러 지자체와 경찰서에 문의해 봤습니다.만약에 좀 극단적으로 출입로가 딱 1개밖에 없어서 차가 줄줄이 못 들어가고 그래서 아파트 주변 도로가 다 마비되는 이런 긴급한 상황이라면 경찰 입회하에 지자체가 차를 다른 쪽으로 옮기는 이 정도의 민원처리는 가능할 것이라는 답변도 한 지자체가 있었지만, 원칙적으로는 아파트가 자체적으로 해결해야 한다, 이런 의견으로 모아졌습니다.[앵커]아파트가 알아서 해결하라는 거잖아요. 그러면 민간 견인업체를 불러서 옮기는 건 어때요?[기자]그건 가능합니다. 다만 조심해야 될 게 있는데요.견인 과정에서 내 차가 파손됐다, 이런 식의 시비가 생길 것에 대비해서 견인 전에 차 상태를 사진 찍어놓는 게 좋습니다.또 이렇게 민간 견인차를 부른 그 비용은 추후에 황당한 주차를 한 그 차주에게 청구를 할 수도 있습니다.[앵커]그러니까 공권력이 강제 견인하는 건 원칙적으로 불가능하고 아파트 관리소가 알아서 하는 건 차주가 괜히 법적 분쟁으로 끌고 갈 수도 있으니까 한마디로 좀 피곤해질 수도 있는 거잖아요. 그런데 아무리 그렇더라도 홧김에 이런 황당주차를 했다가는 징역형까지도 갈 수가 있죠?[기자]그렇습니다. 엄연한 범죄입니다.2018년 8월에 인천 송도의 한 아파트에서도 비슷한 일이 있었습니다.인천지방법원은 차주에게 아파트 측에 주차 관리 업무를 방해한 혐의 등을 인정해서 징역 6개월에 집행유예 2년을 선고했습니다.홧김에 길 막고 차를 두고 떠났다가 소위 빨간줄이 생길 수 있는 겁니다.참고로 집합건물법이나 아파트 규약을 다룬 판례를 보면 특별한 사유가 없는 한 입주민은 아파트에서 정한 스티커 부착 규칙을 잘 따라야 한다고 판단하고 있습니다.[앵커]잘 들었습니다. 오랜만에 생활밀착형 소재였습니다. 팩트체크 이가혁 기자였습니다.※JTBC 팩트체크는 국내 유일 국제팩트체킹네트워크(IFCN) 인증사입니다.(화면출처 : 온라인 커뮤니티)",

          "title": "Hoe België tien jaar na het Heizeldrama EURO 2000 onder zijn hoede mocht nemen",
          "text": "In 2000 ontvingen België en Nederland de Europese voetbaltop voor het eerste landentoernooi georganiseerd door twee landen. Hoe kon België met het Heizeldrama vers in het geheugen zo'n prestigieuze organisatie toegewezen krijgen?\n\nBegin juli 1995 reisden de Belgische en Nederlandse voetbalfederaties af naar de hoofdzetel van de UEFA in Nyon. UEFA-voorzitter Lennart Johansson wees toen de organisatie van het EK voetbal in 2000 toe aan de Lage Landen.\n\nAls enige kandidaten leek de uitverkiezing van België en Nederland op het eerste zicht een formaliteit te zijn, maar in realiteit hadden de twee landen een weg vol vallen en opstaan afgelegd.\n\nSchuld voor het Heizeldrama\n\nDe weg naar EURO 2000 startte al begin jaren 80 toen de KBVB begon te dromen van een volwaardig EK voetbal op Belgisch grondgebied. De editie in 1972 had dan wel plaatsgevonden in België maar die bestond uit amper vier wedstrijden.\n\nDe vage plannen werden al snel overhoop gegooid door het Heizeldrama op 25 mei 1985, dé inktzwarte bladzijde in de vaderlandse voetbalgeschiedenis. Tot dan toe was België een vrij gerespecteerd UEFA-lid dat dankzij het mythische Heizelstadion geregeld een Europacupfinale onder de arm mocht nemen.\n\nRellen tussen supporters van Juventus en Liverpool resulteerden op die fatale zomeravond in 40 doden. Nadat de stofwolken waren opgetrokken, raakten de UEFA en de KBVB al snel verdeeld over de schuldkwestie. De bond wees vooral op het gewelddadige gedrag van de Engelse fans, terwijl de Europese federatie de chaotische ticketverkoop door de Belgen, gecoördineerd door secretaris-generaal Albert Roosens van de bond in vraag stelde. Op de bewuste avond zaten Engelsen en Italianen zo kriskras door elkaar in tribune Z.\n\nDe UEFA waste zijn handen in onschuld en legde België een verbod op van 10 jaar zonder Europacupfinales. De correctionele rechtbank van Brussel stelde vier jaar na de feiten naast veertien fans en de rijkswachtkapitein ook Roosens zelf verantwoordelijk.\n\nVrede van korte duur\n\nOndanks de flink beschadigde relatie tussen Bern en Brussel gebruikten de bond en de overheden het Heizeldrama als stevige wake-upcall om de veiligheid in en rond stadions aan te pakken. Mede door de renovatieplannen van het verkommerde Heizelstadion flakkerde de interesse voor een EK-kandidatuur in 1990 weer voorzichtig op, ditmaal in de vorm van een samenwerking met Nederland.\n\nDe nieuwe UEFA-voorzitter Lennart Johansson verkondigde bovendien dat kleine landen ook best geschikt waren om eindtoernooien onder hun hoede te nemen. De Zweed wilde afrekenen met het beleid van zijn voorganger en toonde zich enigszins vergevingsgezind naar België toe.\n\nNet voor de Mondiale in Italië in 1990 kende hij zijn steun toe aan de bondsvoorzitters Michel D'Hooghe en Jo Van Marle. Enkel de automatische deelname van beide landen zou nog een breekijzer zijn. De UEFA-statuten voorzagen maar één rechtstreeks ticket voor meerdere gastlanden.\n\nDe nieuwe vrede met de UEFA-leiding was echter van korte duur door de juridische wending in het Heizeldrama. Het Brusselse Hof van Cassatie oordeelde in beroep dat toenmalig secretaris-generaal Hans Bangerter en de UEFA dezelfde verantwoordelijkheid droegen voor de ramp als de KBVB en de Belgische overheid. De Europese federatie reageerde als door een wesp gestoken en adviseerde Nederland om zijn eigen koers te varen voor EURO 96.\n\nVoormalig UEFA-voorzitter Lennart Johansson zag wel wat in de bid van België en Nederland © GETTY\n\nBelgië op zwarte lijst\n\nVer uit de schijnwerpers van het Heizelproces begon Jean-Marc Bosman, een modale voetballer van Club Luik, in dezelfde maand aan zijn kruistocht tegen het transfersysteem. Bosman was einde contract en wilde de overstap maken naar Dunkerque. Door hun financiële situatie konden de Fransen de transfersom niet betalen en omdat Bosman een nieuw contractvoorstel van de Luikenaars had geweigerd, stond hij reglementair gezien op non-actief.\n\nBosman trok naar de rechtbank, kreeg gelijk en mocht zo als vrije speler een contract tekenen in Frankrijk. In eerste instantie zag de UEFA het proces van Bosman als een alleenstaand geval van een onbeduidende speler, maar Bosman had bloed geroken. Hij nam advocaten gespecialiseerd in Europees recht onder de arm en begon zich te profileren als martelaar die de voetballer wilde bevrijden van een gedateerd transfersysteem.\n\nBosman sleepte vervolgens de UEFA voor de rechtbank op basis van de vrijheid van arbeid binnen de EU. De Belgische bond raakte zo verstrikt in twee juridische veldslagen waarbij de UEFA met de vinger werd gewezen. In Nederland drong het besef door dat de zuiderburen eerder een last dan een meerwaarde waren. Dat gevoel werd enkel versterkt na nieuwe rellen tijdens de bekerfinale in het Heizelstadion.\n\nNadat het Hof van Cassatie niet afweek van de aansprakelijkheid van de UEFA en de schadeloosstelling aan de slachtoffers, zakte de relatie tussen België en de UEFA tot een historisch dieptepunt. Vooral de voorwaardelijke gevangenisstraf van Hans Bangerter, secretaris-generaal van de UEFA, in België smaakte bitter. Voortaan zouden de Europese voetballeiders voor elke onregelmatigheid in één van hun evenementen gestraft kunnen worden.\n\nBelgië werd daarom officieel besmet gebied verklaard en vloog op de zwarte lijst voor Europacupfinales. Nog voor de sancties vanuit Zwitserland duidelijk waren, trad de bond definitief uit de race voor EURO 96, officieel vanwege de onzekerheid over de automatische deelname van zowel België als Nederland aan een toernooi van acht landen.\n\nThe Low Countries\n\nHet rampjaar 1991 schudde de KBVB niettemin wakker. Het teken dat net Engeland de concurrentiestrijd om EURO 96 won, was het bewijs dat de UEFA vergevingsgezind was. Dankzij eerste minister Jean-Luc Dehaene kwam er eindelijk duidelijkheid rond het toekomstbeeld van de vervloekte Heizel.\n\nDe wijdverspreide campagne voor fair play op en naast het veld en de goede werking van het opvangtehuis Casa Hogar in Mexico wierpen zijn vruchten af: België ontving de FIFA Fair Play prijs in 1992 uit handen van uitgerekend Johansson. De belangrijkste overwinning die dag was vooral de verzoening over de schuldvraag van het Heizeldrama. Een nieuwe Belgisch-Nederlandse EK-kandidatuur kwam zo alweer snel tot stand.\n\nDe vele gesprekken tussen D'Hooghe en de nieuwe Nederlandse bondsvoorzitter Jeu Sprengers resulteerden begin 1994 in de presentatie van de officiële kandidatuur onder de slogan \"The Low Countries and EURO 2000\". De Lage Landen waren daarnaast de enige geïnteresseerden.\n\nDe reacties vanuit Bern waren gemengd: de Belgische stadioninfrastructuur bestond voorlopig enkel uit een te renoveren Heizelstadion en de nasleep van het Heizeldrama lag plots weer gevoelig. Daarnaast dook de zaak-Bosman opnieuw op. Na veel juridisch getouwtrek kreeg Bosman eindelijk zekerheid over de promotie van zijn zaak naar het Europese Hof van Justitie.\n\nDe UEFA was niet van plan om het EK zomaar cadeau te geven, zeker omdat het toernooi in 2000 voor het eerst met 16 landen georganiseerd zou worden als gevolg van de val van het communisme in Oost-Europa.\n\nDe achtste handtekening\n\nBij de eerste deadline van het definitieve bidbook in maart 1995 kreeg de kandidatuur dan ook rood licht. Het stadiondossier was ontoereikend en de fiscale vrijstelling van spelers was een twistpunt voor de overheden. De Lage Landen trokken terug naar de tekentafel en begonnen aan een race tegen de klok.

De voetbalwereld rekende erop dat het Europese Hof van Justitie begrip zou opbrengen voor het specifieke karakter van de voetbalsport.\n\nDe uiteindelijke uitspraak van het Hof op 15 december sloeg echter in als een bom. Bosman kreeg gelijk waardoor spelers aan het eind van hun contract voortaan transfervrij konden vertrekken en de beperkingen op het aantal buitenlandse EU-spelers volledig wegvielen.\n\nDe hevig om zich heen schoppende UEFA besefte niettemin dat het met de vinger wijzen naar België niet langer zin had. De KBVB was immers toevallig slachtoffer omdat Jean-Marc Bosman, een Belg, wilde vertrekken bij een Belgische club. Om de nieuwe verstandhouding te bezegelen, kreeg het Koning Boudewijnstadion de finale van Europacup II in 1996 toegewezen, een eerste test richting EURO 2000 maar vooral een symbolische handdruk tussen de UEFA en de KBVB, na tien jaar van vriend- en vooral vijandschap.\n\nBegin juli 1995 reisden de Belgische en Nederlandse voetbalfederaties af naar de hoofdzetel van de UEFA in Nyon. UEFA-voorzitter Lennart Johansson wees toen de organisatie van het EK voetbal in 2000 toe aan de Lage Landen. Als enige kandidaten leek de uitverkiezing van België en Nederland op het eerste zicht een formaliteit te zijn, maar in realiteit hadden de twee landen een weg vol vallen en opstaan afgelegd.De weg naar EURO 2000 startte al begin jaren 80 toen de KBVB begon te dromen van een volwaardig EK voetbal op Belgisch grondgebied. De editie in 1972 had dan wel plaatsgevonden in België maar die bestond uit amper vier wedstrijden. De vage plannen werden al snel overhoop gegooid door het Heizeldrama op 25 mei 1985, dé inktzwarte bladzijde in de vaderlandse voetbalgeschiedenis. Tot dan toe was België een vrij gerespecteerd UEFA-lid dat dankzij het mythische Heizelstadion geregeld een Europacupfinale onder de arm mocht nemen. Rellen tussen supporters van Juventus en Liverpool resulteerden op die fatale zomeravond in 40 doden. Nadat de stofwolken waren opgetrokken, raakten de UEFA en de KBVB al snel verdeeld over de schuldkwestie. De bond wees vooral op het gewelddadige gedrag van de Engelse fans, terwijl de Europese federatie de chaotische ticketverkoop door de Belgen, gecoördineerd door secretaris-generaal Albert Roosens van de bond in vraag stelde. Op de bewuste avond zaten Engelsen en Italianen zo kriskras door elkaar in tribune Z.De UEFA waste zijn handen in onschuld en legde België een verbod op van 10 jaar zonder Europacupfinales. De correctionele rechtbank van Brussel stelde vier jaar na de feiten naast veertien fans en de rijkswachtkapitein ook Roosens zelf verantwoordelijk. Ondanks de flink beschadigde relatie tussen Bern en Brussel gebruikten de bond en de overheden het Heizeldrama als stevige wake-upcall om de veiligheid in en rond stadions aan te pakken. Mede door de renovatieplannen van het verkommerde Heizelstadion flakkerde de interesse voor een EK-kandidatuur in 1990 weer voorzichtig op, ditmaal in de vorm van een samenwerking met Nederland.De nieuwe UEFA-voorzitter Lennart Johansson verkondigde bovendien dat kleine landen ook best geschikt waren om eindtoernooien onder hun hoede te nemen. De Zweed wilde afrekenen met het beleid van zijn voorganger en toonde zich enigszins vergevingsgezind naar België toe. Net voor de Mondiale in Italië in 1990 kende hij zijn steun toe aan de bondsvoorzitters Michel D'Hooghe en Jo Van Marle. Enkel de automatische deelname van beide landen zou nog een breekijzer zijn. De UEFA-statuten voorzagen maar één rechtstreeks ticket voor meerdere gastlanden. De nieuwe vrede met de UEFA-leiding was echter van korte duur door de juridische wending in het Heizeldrama. Het Brusselse Hof van Cassatie oordeelde in beroep dat toenmalig secretaris-generaal Hans Bangerter en de UEFA dezelfde verantwoordelijkheid droegen voor de ramp als de KBVB en de Belgische overheid. De Europese federatie reageerde als door een wesp gestoken en adviseerde Nederland om zijn eigen koers te varen voor EURO 96.Ver uit de schijnwerpers van het Heizelproces begon Jean-Marc Bosman, een modale voetballer van Club Luik, in dezelfde maand aan zijn kruistocht tegen het transfersysteem. Bosman was einde contract en wilde de overstap maken naar Dunkerque. Door hun financiële situatie konden de Fransen de transfersom niet betalen en omdat Bosman een nieuw contractvoorstel van de Luikenaars had geweigerd, stond hij reglementair gezien op non-actief.Bosman trok naar de rechtbank, kreeg gelijk en mocht zo als vrije speler een contract tekenen in Frankrijk. In eerste instantie zag de UEFA het proces van Bosman als een alleenstaand geval van een onbeduidende speler, maar Bosman had bloed geroken. Hij nam advocaten gespecialiseerd in Europees recht onder de arm en begon zich te profileren als martelaar die de voetballer wilde bevrijden van een gedateerd transfersysteem.Bosman sleepte vervolgens de UEFA voor de rechtbank op basis van de vrijheid van arbeid binnen de EU. De Belgische bond raakte zo verstrikt in twee juridische veldslagen waarbij de UEFA met de vinger werd gewezen. In Nederland drong het besef door dat de zuiderburen eerder een last dan een meerwaarde waren. Dat gevoel werd enkel versterkt na nieuwe rellen tijdens de bekerfinale in het Heizelstadion. Nadat het Hof van Cassatie niet afweek van de aansprakelijkheid van de UEFA en de schadeloosstelling aan de slachtoffers, zakte de relatie tussen België en de UEFA tot een historisch dieptepunt. Vooral de voorwaardelijke gevangenisstraf van Hans Bangerter, secretaris-generaal van de UEFA, in België smaakte bitter. Voortaan zouden de Europese voetballeiders voor elke onregelmatigheid in één van hun evenementen gestraft kunnen worden. België werd daarom officieel besmet gebied verklaard en vloog op de zwarte lijst voor Europacupfinales. Nog voor de sancties vanuit Zwitserland duidelijk waren, trad de bond definitief uit de race voor EURO 96, officieel vanwege de onzekerheid over de automatische deelname van zowel België als Nederland aan een toernooi van acht landen.Het rampjaar 1991 schudde de KBVB niettemin wakker. Het teken dat net Engeland de concurrentiestrijd om EURO 96 won, was het bewijs dat de UEFA vergevingsgezind was. Dankzij eerste minister Jean-Luc Dehaene kwam er eindelijk duidelijkheid rond het toekomstbeeld van de vervloekte Heizel.De wijdverspreide campagne voor fair play op en naast het veld en de goede werking van het opvangtehuis Casa Hogar in Mexico wierpen zijn vruchten af: België ontving de FIFA Fair Play prijs in 1992 uit handen van uitgerekend Johansson. De belangrijkste overwinning die dag was vooral de verzoening over de schuldvraag van het Heizeldrama. Een nieuwe Belgisch-Nederlandse EK-kandidatuur kwam zo alweer snel tot stand.De vele gesprekken tussen D'Hooghe en de nieuwe Nederlandse bondsvoorzitter Jeu Sprengers resulteerden begin 1994 in de presentatie van de officiële kandidatuur onder de slogan \"The Low Countries and EURO 2000\". De Lage Landen waren daarnaast de enige geïnteresseerden. De reacties vanuit Bern waren gemengd: de Belgische stadioninfrastructuur bestond voorlopig enkel uit een te renoveren Heizelstadion en de nasleep van het Heizeldrama lag plots weer gevoelig. Daarnaast dook de zaak-Bosman opnieuw op. Na veel juridisch getouwtrek kreeg Bosman eindelijk zekerheid over de promotie van zijn zaak naar het Europese Hof van Justitie. De UEFA was niet van plan om het EK zomaar cadeau te geven, zeker omdat het toernooi in 2000 voor het eerst met 16 landen georganiseerd zou worden als gevolg van de val van het communisme in Oost-Europa.Bij de eerste deadline van het definitieve bidbook in maart 1995 kreeg de kandidatuur dan ook rood licht. Het stadiondossier was ontoereikend en de fiscale vrijstelling van spelers was een twistpunt voor de overheden. De Lage Landen trokken terug naar de tekentafel en begonnen aan een race tegen de klok. Tussendoor streek het EK U16 neer in België, het eerste UEFA-toernooi sinds het Heizeldrama.Met de deadline in zicht bleef het vereiste aantal van acht stadions een pijnpunt. Vooral de minimumcapaciteit van 30.000 zitplaatsen bleek voor vele Belgische stadioneigenaars een brug te ver in financieel opzicht. Het lobbywerk van D'Hooghe en Alain Courtois, de nieuwe secretaris-generaal, leverde nieuwe handtekeningen op uit Charleroi, Luik en Brugge.

          "title": "The Stump Speech Analyzer: Donald Trump in Tulsa",
          "text": "Editor’s note: PolitiFact’s Stump Speech Analyzer looks at the content and accuracy of candidate stump speeches. Following our summary of the speech’s main themes, we present fact-checks of specific talking points. Read our previous stump speech analyzers for Joe Biden and the Democratic primary field.\n\nThe stump speech: Trump’s 1-hour, 40-minute speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, June 20, 2020\n\nIn his first political rally since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, President Donald Trump attacked his opponent Joe Biden, excoriated protestors and stoked racial tensions on a variety of issues.\n\nSumming up his complaints, Trump said, \"In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law-abiding citizens.\"\n\nTrump spent over six minutes explaining why he walked unsteadily down a ramp at the graduation of West Point cadets in June. He said the \"fake news\" suggested he was ill, but he was wearing shoes that slipped easily, and the speech actually showed his stamina.\n\nTrump also spent time talking about how calls to \"defund the police\" would leave Americans vulnerable to crime, and he repeatedly mentioned MS-13, a criminal gang with ties to Central America.\n\n\"I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away … you call 911, and they say, I'm sorry, this number’s no longer working.\"\n\nTrump attacked U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, calling her a \"hate-filled, America-bashing socialist\" who would \"make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia — no government, no safety, no police, no nothing, just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country.\"\n\nTrump also suggested he intends to revive his feud with the NFL after commissioner Roger Goodell said in a formal statement that the NFL supports the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has attacked players who kneeled during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality.\n\n\"I like Roger Goodell,\" Trump said. \"but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, where did that come from in the middle of the summer? … We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag.\"\n\nOn the coronavirus, Trump said it should be called \"the Chinese virus\" and referred to it as \"kung flu.\" He also complained he didn’t get enough credit for travel restrictions he enacted and said that testing that revealed minor COVID-19 cases was making him look bad.\n\nBiggest applause line: After criticizing at length calls to defund the police: \"You are so lucky I’m president, that’s all I can tell you.\"\n\nRe-election vision: Trump said \"sleepy\" Joe Biden is a confused \"puppet of the left,\" and the economy will come roaring back if Trump is re-elected.\n\nMusic: \"God Bless the USA,\" by Lee Greenwood to open; \"You Can’t Always Get What You Want,\" by the Rolling Stones to close\n\nBefore the speech: Public officials had warned that the gathering could spread COVID-19; a court challenge to delay the rally ultimately failed. The original date of the rally was scheduled for June 19, or Juneteenth, a day marking the end of slavery in America; it was moved one day later. Tulsa marked the 99th anniversary this month of one of the worst massacres of black residents by a white mob in America.\n\nAnything else: The campaign had hyped 1 million people registering an RSVP for the rally, but the 19,000-seat BOK Center had many empty seats. Camera shots of the crowd showed only small portion of the crowd wearing masks.\n\nFact-checking Trump’s statements\n\n\"Testing (for COVID-19) is a double-edged sword… when you do testing to that extent you're gonna find more people you're gonna find more cases.\"\n\nTrump miscasts rising case numbers as simply the result of more testing, but that’s not what’s happening.\n\nThe country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak — per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run. But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting.\n\nAnd diagnostic testing isn’t the only data that reflect the pandemic’s reach. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence.\n\nDemocrats \"want to defund and dissolve our police departments.\"\n\nSome activists do want to defund and dissolve police, but this description distorts most Democratic proposals. With a few exceptions, elected officials and activists who speak of defunding the police mean something more targeted. They want to focus police departments on criminal activity, and peel off the need for them to respond to domestic disputes, homeless people and the mentally ill.\n\nKailee Scales, managing director for Black Lives Matter Network Action Fund and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., said June 8 that the group was calling for a \"divestment in police in order to support more teachers, mental health and restorative services, community resilience departments, social workers, and government resource liaisons.\"\n\n\"We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States military.\"\n\nThis exaggerates the actual spending. Trump’s ballpark number is reasonably accurate in terms of defense budgets over the past four years. But weapon systems take a long time to build. To put this into perspective, the Pentagon spent roughly $419 billion on procurement through the first three fiscal years of Trump’s presidency. And while that’s just for material goods, that’s a far cry from $2 trillion.\n\nThe bulk of the $2 trillion would have been spent anyway, regardless of who was president.\n\n\"Most of that money was going to be spent under Obama,\" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \"Trump’s net increases have been about $100 billion each year, or $400 billion total compared with earlier expectations.\"\n\n\"They've wanted to do (Veterans Choice) for almost fifty years. We got it done.\"\n\nThis started before Trump was elected. Broadly, Veterans Choice allows veterans to see a doctor and get care outside the VA system. It was first approved in 2014 and took effect in 2015. It is fair to say that under Trump, the program was expanded and given more permanent funding, but it existed before he took office.\n\n\"We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country.\"\n\nWrong. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh. The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy).\n\nThe largest, providing $321 billion per year in tax cuts, was the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The 2017 tax cut provided $150 billion in tax relief.",

This is DEEP.\" It reads:\n\n\"On February 3, 1903 Jack Johnson became the first ‘negro’ heavy weight title champion. But, did you know he was also an inventor? While in Jail in Kansas, he invented the wrench! In 1922 he received a patent for his invention. In fact, white people still found a way to tarnish this great accomplishment by dubbing it the ‘monkey wrench’. A term many use freely today. Do the math!\"\n\nThe June 15 Instagram post, which gained more than 700,000 likes, was shared during the fourth week of national protests over police brutality following the death of George Floyd. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWho was Johnson?\n\nJohnson, the son of former slaves, won the unified heavyweight championship in 1908. The International Boxing Hall of Fame shared this description of him: \"A gaudy, bold character who lived just as he wanted, Johnson enraged the defenders of white supremacy with his refusal to accept anything less than equality. He was beloved by blacks and some whites, but thoroughly hated and eventually conquered by those who saw him as a threat to America's divided society.\"\n\nIn 1913, Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act, which made it a felony to transport across state lines \"any woman or girls for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose,\" but was used to prosecute people involved in premarital, extramarital and interracial relationships. Johnson was traveling with his white girlfriend who later became his wife. He served a year at Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Johnson in 2018, saying he had received a request from Sylvester Stallone.\n\nJohnson's wrench came later\n\nJohnson was awarded a patent for a wrench that improved gripping and made disassembly easier.\n\n\"My invention relates to improvements in wrenches and has for its object to provide an improved wrench, which is of simple and durable construction, reliable in operation and easy and inexpensive to manufacture, which may be easily and readily adjusted and which is adapted to exert a powerful gripping action upon the work,\" he wrote in his application, which was filed in March 1921. The patent was awarded in April 1922.\n\nJohnson had conceptualized and diagrammed a tool to help tighten loosening fastening devices while at Leavenworth, according to the Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University in Michigan.\n\nBut the first wrench had been patented in 1835, and the first monkey wrench was patented around 1858.\n\nA monkey wrench, by the way, is a wrench with one fixed and one adjustable jaw at right angles to a straight handle.\n\nThere is some dispute about the origin of the name \"monkey wrench.\" The Jim Crow Museum says that it was named using a purposeful misspelling of the name of the inventor, Charles Moncky. An alternative explanation is that the wrench was invented before Moncky’s wrench and got its name because it was similar to a \"key wrench,\" but was different enough to be called a \"non-key\" wrench.\n\nOur ruling\n\nJohnson did get a patent for a wrench he invented while in prison.\n\nBut it was not the first wrench ever invented, and the original as well as one that became known as the monkey wrench were patented decades earlier. The origin of the monkey wrench name had nothing to do with Johnson.\n\nWe rate the statement False.",

          "text": "President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States — which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost — by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing.\n\n\"If you don't test, you don't have any cases,\" Trump said at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House. \"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\"\n\nIt’s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It’s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day.\n\nWith that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president’s remarks are not only misleading — they’re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what’s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe big picture\n\nEssentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more – and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do.\n\n\"We will show more — more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don’t talk about it,\" he added.\n\nBut that isn’t true.\n\nThe numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump’s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak — per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run.\n\nBut this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries – so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others.\n\nA way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it’s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19.\n\nFor instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.’s.\n\n\"We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,\" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nPut another way, a larger health crisis means — even after controlling for population size — the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nAnd while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don’t have sufficient systems in place — from facilities to staff to medical supplies — for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us.\n\nIf we stopped testing?\n\nAnd what about the president’s assertion that \"if we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases\" or none at all?\n\nOn its literal phrasing, it’s absurd, experts said.\n\n\"The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That’s because testing doesn’t create instances of the virus — it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.)\n\nBut even if you take it figuratively – the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic – it’s still misleading.\n\n\"We’re seeing a lot of cases because we’re testing? It just doesn’t ring true,\" Kates said. \"The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished.\"\n\nThe president’s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated – and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. \"If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,\" Blendon said. \"If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he’s gone.\"\n\nBut the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus.\n\nThat gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn’t the only data source to reveal the pandemic’s existence. Let’s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus’s absence.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump argued that the nation’s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect.\n\nThe most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn’t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we’re probably still undercounting compared to other countries.\n\nTesting doesn’t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it.\n\nAnd in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public’s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn’t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn’t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis. We rate it Pants on Fire.",

          "text": "Nonprofit organizations often incorporate to reap tax benefits and legal protections. They enter into fiscal sponsorships when they are not yet recognized as tax-exempt by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network has a fiscal sponsorship with Thousand Currents, a nonprofit that works with grassroots groups and handles Black Lives Matter’s finances, including donations.\n\nLike many nonprofit organizations, Black Lives Matter Global Network is incorporated and operates as a charity.\n\nAs donations continue to flow into Black Lives Matter, some conservative commentators claim the civil rights organization behind the movement is not an actual charity.\n\n\"According to its website Black Lives Matter, Inc is NOT a charity. It is a full-fledged corporation that does NOT have any locations,\" said Candace Owens in a June 11 tweet. \"Can anyone tell me then where the hundreds of millions BLM has raised goes?\"\n\nThe tweet, which has also been shared as a screenshot on Instagram, has been retweeted more than 47,000 times.\n\nThe Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\n\nWe previously fact-checked a false claim that donations to Black Lives Matter are funneled to ActBlue, a nonprofit technology company that helps Democratic campaigns and causes raise funds. So we wanted to look into this post, too.\n\n(Screenshot from Twitter)\n\nOwens is wrong. The Black Lives Matter Global Network is incorporated in Delaware, but it’s a charity that’s fiscally sponsored by another nonprofit called Thousand Currents. The Black Lives Matter Global Network has chapters around the country.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is decentralized with no formal hierarchy. It was co-founded by three black community organizers in 2013, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nKhan-Cullors, Garza and Tometi created Black Lives Matter Global Network as an outgrowth of that movement, with a stated mission to \"build local power and to intervene when violence was inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.\" The network was incorporated in Delaware in November 2016, according to the state’s corporations division.\n\nBut nowhere on its website does the Black Lives Matter Global Network describe itself primarily as a \"corporation,\" as Owens claimed — and the organization still operates as a charity.\n\nIncorporation is a common first step toward becoming a nonprofit organization because it offers tax advantages and legal protections. While nonprofits that incorporate are technically corporations, they are still considered nonprofits. Why?\n\n\"Congress has created almost three dozen types of tax-exempt organizations in different sections of the tax code,\" says the National Council of Nonprofits. \"The one common condition is not paying out profits\" to owners or shareholders.\n\nFor example, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which owns PolitiFact, is incorporated in Florida and uses its earnings to develop teaching programs and online content for journalists. The institute also has an incorporated foundation.\n\nSimilarly, the Black Lives Matter Global Network has a foundation that was incorporated in Delaware one year after the network. Since it’s a relatively new nonprofit, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has a partnership with a larger organization that oversees its finances.\n\nIn 2016, the Black Lives Matter Global Network approached Thousand Currents, a nonprofit organization that partners with grassroots groups and movements, to create a fiscal-sponsorship agreement. Fiscal sponsorships are set up when a charitable organization is \"not yet recognized as tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3),\" according to the National Council of Nonprofits.\n\n\"In this capacity, we provide administrative and back-office support, including finance, accounting, grants management, insurance, human resources, legal and compliance,\" a spokesperson for Thousand Currents said in an email. \"Donations to BLM are restricted donations to support the activities of BLM.\"\n\nSince the Black Lives Matter Global Network is not yet its own 501(c)(3) organization, it does not have publicly available tax returns. Other nonprofits named after the Black Lives Matter movement, such as the \"Black Lives Matter Foundation\" in California, are not associated with the network, BuzzFeed News reported June 15.\n\nHowever, some financial information about the Black Lives Matter Global Network is available on Thousand Currents’ most recent financial audit.\n\nRELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that?\n\nThat document indicates that, as of June 2019, Thousand Currents held $3.35 million in assets representing restricted donations for the Black Lives Matter Global Network. The same audit shows that $1.8 million in restricted donations were released to Black Lives Matter in the year ended June 30, 2019.\n\nReferred to simply as the \"fiscal project\" on Thousand Currents’ audit, Black Lives Matter spent much of that money on salaries, consultants and travel. We look at Thousand Currents’ most recent tax returns to get a clearer picture, but they do not report separate expenditures for the Black Lives Matter Global Network or a \"fiscal project.\"\n\nIn a June 11 statement, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation announced the creation of a $6.5 million fund for grassroots organizing efforts. The fund is available to all chapters affiliated with the network and will give unrestricted grants of up to $500,000.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network has active chapters in 16 cities in Canada and the United States, according to its website. Most chapters have a website and corresponding social media profiles, many of which are verified.\n\nWe reached out to the Black Lives Matter Global Network repeatedly for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.\n\nRegardless, Owens’ tweet is inaccurate. We rate it False.",

          "text": "These employees must be sick with coronavirus, taking care of someone or otherwise deemed unable to work from home by a supervisor.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has left millions without work in the United States.\n\nIn Wisconsin, more than 2.6 million weekly unemployment claims were filed between March 15 and May 30, 2020. And though the number of weekly claims has gradually declined, more than 728,000 claims remained unpaid at the end of May.\n\nThe state Department of Workforce Development is working to hire additional workers to handle unemployment claims. But former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who lost to Democrat Tony Evers in 2018, has his own idea of how to tackle it.\n\n\"Assign all state employees who have been idle at home to process unemployment benefits,\" Walker said in a June 5, 2020 tweet.\n\nAre there really state workers sitting \"idle at home\" during the crisis?\n\nThe claim\n\nThe June 5, 2020 tweet wasn’t the first time Walker, who is now president-elect of the conservative group Young America’s Foundation, made such a claim.\n\nIn a May 20, 2020 New York Times Op-Ed, he wrote \"many state government employees are still receiving paychecks as they sit idle at home.\"\n\nWhen asked to back up the claim, a Walker spokesperson pointed to a March 23, 2020 memo to Wisconsin state employees from Department of Administration secretary Joel Brennan.\n\nA provision of the memo says non-essential employees who are unable to do their jobs from home are eligible to use up to 80 hours of paid administrative leave.\n\nEmployees eligible for the administrative leave are available for alternative assignments, including to support \"various activities around the state’s COVID‐19 response efforts,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe provision took effect March 25, 2020. Both non-essential employees and appointed employees are eligible for administrative leave, but those hired in response to the coronavirus pandemic are not. The memo says employees may use the money to cover normal work hours for those who are sick or deemed \"unable to telework\" by their supervisor.\n\nThe state of state workers\n\nWisconsin Department of Administration spokesperson Molly Vidal called Walker’s statement a \"gross oversimplification.\"\n\nVidal said the policy allows employees who have not yet earned paid administrative leave benefits \"to access leave if they contracted COVID-19, needed to care for a family member with COVID-19 or due to the sudden closure of childcare facilities.\"\n\nShe emphasized that employees are required to use up all other leave options — such as paid vacation time — before being able to use this administrative leave.\n\nVidal added that 8 percent of eligible state employees are using the program -- or, about 2 percent of all state employees. These employees, she noted, are often custodians, facility repair workers and tour guides.\n\nBeyond that, hundreds of state employees have been temporarily reassigned to assist with the state’s coronavirus response, according to Vidal. Some of the tasks include transporting testing supplies and becoming coronavirus contact tracers.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWalker claimed there are state employees being paid to sit \"idle\" at home.\n\nAlthough there are state employees who are being compensated while unable to work due to coronavirus, there are stipulations that need to be met before a non-essential worker can qualify for paid administrative leave. What’s more, some people in nonessential jobs and unable to work from home have been put on to other COVD-related tasks.\n\nOur definition of Half True is \"the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\n\nThat fits here.",

          "text": "• Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently in June, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is receiving criticism for his decision to restart in-person, indoor rallies with an event in Tulsa on June 20. During a White House roundtable on June 15, Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump’s decision by praising Oklahoma’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt a discussion of issues affecting older Americans, Pence said, \"The president and I have both spoken to (Oklahoma) Gov. Kevin Stitt in the last several days and even earlier today. And Oklahoma has really been in the forefront of our efforts to slow the spread. And in a very real sense, they've flattened the curve. And today, their hospital capacity is abundant. The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward with the rally this coming weekend.\"\n\nHowever, Pence’s remarks represent an unduly optimistic reading of Oklahoma’s actual coronavirus data. (The Trump campaign and the White House did not respond to inquiries.)\n\nThe state opened some businesses on April 24 and others on May 1.\n\nWe looked at the raw data for Oklahoma from the Covid Tracking Project. The following chart shows both the daily number of new, confirmed cases in Oklahoma and the seven-day rolling average, which smooths out day-to-day variations in the data. (For instance, weekends often show artificially low totals because offices are closed.)\n\nThe strongest evidence for Pence’s characterization comes in the early part of the period. From early March to early April, the daily case count skyrocketed, but then it eased and remained more or less in check through the end of May.\n\nThis fits the pattern of \"flattening the curve,\" a term that gained currency early in the pandemic to describe a hoped-for phenomenon by which Americans would stay at home to stop the virus’ spread, thus keeping new infections from overwhelming the hospital system.\n\nHowever, Pence overstated the case.\n\nFirst, it’s incorrect to say that infections in Oklahoma \"declined precipitously.\" As the chart shows, it was, at best, a modest decline between early April and the end of May. It could be more accurately described as a plateau.\n\nSecond, any \"flattening the curve\" period is old news. Over the most recent week, the number of new cases has increased every day and produced a spike beyond anything previously seen in Oklahoma. The seven-day rolling average for new infections is now more than double where it stood at the end of May, just before the spike began.\n\n\"It looks from the data that the number of cases is on the rise, and rising quite steeply,\" said Nicole Gatto, associate professor in the School of Community and Global Health at Claremont Graduate University.\n\nTara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, agreed.\n\n\"The seven-day average doesn't look great for the most recent part of June,\" Smith said. \"They had slowed new cases for a while, but the trend now seems to be reversing.\"\n\nEqually important, the recent spike does not appear to be traceable to a big surge in testing. Here’s a chart of the seven-day rolling average of daily tests in Oklahoma:\n\nThe number of tests conducted has generally risen over time. But the number of tests actually fell during the period when the number of new infections was spiking.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPence said, \"In a very real sense, (Oklahoma has) flattened the curve. ... The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously.\"\n\nThis observation is outdated and inaccurate. In June, Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.\n\nWe rate the statement False.",

          "title": "GOP renews line against McMurray’s work, and it’s still wrong",
          "text": "Republican Chris Jacobs, running for Congress in New York’s 27th District, uses a familiar line of attack against his opponent, Democrat Nate McMurray.\n\nThe Jacobs ad, \"Steals,\" says: \"As a lawyer working in Korea, Nate McMurray helped send American jobs to Asia, supporting trade agreements costing us thousands of jobs. McMurray even helped American companies hire foreign workers.\"\n\nJust two years ago, when Rep. Chris Collins campaigned against McMurray, the Collins camp sent direct mail to voters with the claim \"Nate McMurray lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)\"\n\nVoters in all or part of eight counties in Western New York cast their ballots in a special election on June 23. We wanted to fact-check this persistent claim, specifically that \"As a lawyer working in Korea, Nate McMurray helped send American jobs to Asia.\"\n\nJacobs’ argument\n\nMcMurray worked in Asia as a corporate lawyer from 2006 to 2013, first in China, then in Korea. In Korea, he helped foreign companies invest there and resolve employment issues.\n\nWe reached out to the Jacobs campaign about the ad, and received information regarding McMurray’s involvement with a chamber of commerce when he worked as a lawyer in Korea, as well as a list of news articles that detailed how companies moved operations to Asia, or established new operations there.\n\nThe Jacobs campaign says that in 2011, McMurray was a vice chairman of the Foreign Investment Committee of The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which we verified through a document from the chamber. The chamber paid roughly $30,000 to lobby for the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, according to a 2011 U.S. Senate Lobbying Report, provided by Jacobs.\n\nIn their memo on the ad, the GOP campaign also sent articles that stated that the U.S.-Korea trade deal from 2012, supported by the chamber, led to a more than doubling of the U.S. goods trade deficit, according to Reuters, and \"more than 95,000 lost U.S. jobs,\" according to an analysis from the union-backed Economic Policy Institute in 2016. (The White House said in 2018 that the goods trade deficit grew by 75 percent under the 2012 agreement.) The biggest source of the trade deficit was related to car sales, according to Vox in 2018.\n\nThe Jacobs memo also has links to articles about Western New York companies that moved their operations, though many of these moves happened before the trade deal took effect in March 2012, or the work went to countries other than South Korea. These examples included American Axle closing its Cheektowaga plant in 2011, and Ford laying off 150 workers at its Buffalo stamping plant, also in 2011. Also on the list was New Era’s shutdown of its Derby plant in 2019, and its move to manufacturing in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Haiti, as well as an operation in Miami. In another example from the memo, New Era opened an office in South Korea around 2013, leading to retail stores there.\n\nThe Jacobs campaign’s argument is that because McMurray was a co-chair of a committee in the chamber, he had something to do with the chamber’s lobbying activities in favor of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement.\n\nBut in 2011, the chamber had around 2,000 individual members and 1,000 member companies. In 2018, McMurray’s campaign told us that McMurray did not participate in lobbying activities.\n\nMcMurray’s work\n\nAs a lawyer in Korea, McMurray helped American companies enter the Korean market, according to Thomas Pinansky, a former partner at Barun Law in Seoul. Pinansky recruited McMurray and spoke to PolitiFact in 2018.\n\nMcMurray helped American companies succeed in the Korean market, historically a difficult market to penetrate, Pinansky said. \"He would have no authority to export jobs, U.S. jobs overseas,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, McMurray’s former campaign manager told us about McMurray’s work as a lawyer in Asia, and said: \"In none of these positions did he have the authority to outsource any jobs.\"\n\nWhen PolitiFact fact-checked a claim that McMurray \"lobbied to send our jobs\" to China and Korea, we found it to be False.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRepeating a talking point from the Collins campaign, the Jacobs campaign took aim at McMurray for his previous job that it says helped send American jobs to Asia.\n\nThis claim is becoming an old chestnut on the campaign trail whenever McMurray is on the ballot.\n\nWe rated it False when the Collins campaign made it.\n\nAnd nothing Jacobs says now is making it any more credible.\n\nMcMurray was one of thousands of members of a business association that supported the U.S.-Korea trade agreement, which took effect in March 2012. After the trade deal took effect, the trade deficit grew.\n\nBut nothing Jacobs provided showed that McMurray was responsible for American jobs moving to Asia, whether it was New Era moving their manufacturing offshore, but not to Korea, or New Era seeking to sell their products in retail stores in Korea, or American Axle closing its Cheektowaga plant months before U.S.-Korea trade deal even took effect.\n\nIt was False two years ago.\n\nAnd it remains False now.",

          "text": "The al Qaeda terrorist leader didn’t endorse Biden. A Trump campaign ad says Trump is endorsed by veterans and first responders, while Biden is endorsed by bin Laden, but bin Laden never had the choice between Trump and Biden.\n\nBin Laden was killed in 2011, and officials say Obama was never in danger.\n\nIn a memo made public in 2012, bin Laden called for the assassination of then-President Barack Obama, saying it would lead the United States into crisis because “Biden is totally unprepared for the post.”\n\nIt’s Father’s Day weekend. What do you get for a very wealthy man who also occupies the Oval Office?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. had something for his father: A scrap of text from the seized documents of Osama bin Laden, the former head of al Qaeda, mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, killed by U.S. special operations forces in 2011.\n\nIn an interview with President Donald Trump, Trump Jr. unveiled a passage describing bin Laden’s desire to kill President Barack Obama.\n\n\"He wanted to assassinate President Obama because it would put Joe Biden in charge, and essentially he's so grossly incompetent, it would lead to the destruction of America,\" Trump Jr. said June 18 on his YouTube program \"Triggered.\" \"What does it say to you, that basically the Democrat nominee for president of the United States got the posthumous Osama bin Laden endorsement?\"\n\nThe father and son were engaging in a bit of political theater, because Trump senior said that if it was true, he’d make a commercial around it.\n\n\"It’s true,\" Trump Jr. said.\n\n\"OK, we speak the truth,\" Trump said.\n\nAnd then they played the ad, which contrasted Trump and Biden. Fighter jets and endorsements from veterans and firefighters symbolized Trump.\n\n\"Joe Biden endorsed by Osama bin Laden\" was the line about Biden.\n\nHere, we examine whether there’s any truth to that.\n\nBin Laden disparaged Biden\n\nHere’s the accurate part of that exchange. During the years bin Laden was holed up in his compound in Pakistan, he still sought to cripple American power in the Middle East.\n\nWhen American special operations forces raided bin Laden’s compound in 2011, on Obama’s orders, they found a trove of computer files. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence translated and published the last of that material in 2017. Among the many memos was one where bin Laden called for the assassination of Obama.\n\n\"Obama is the head of infidelity, and killing him automatically will make Biden take over the presidency,\" bin Laden wrote, according to a 2012 Washington Post article. \"Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis.\"\n\nNow, this plot never went far, and officials said this never posed a real risk to Obama. But bin Laden had a poor opinion of Biden.\n\nNot an endorsement\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines endorsement as the \"act of giving one's public approval or support to someone or something.\"\n\nPoliticians seek endorsements all the time, and roll them out at strategic moments in their campaigns to win more votes. An endorsement is a positive statement that speaks to a candidate’s good qualities.\n\nPolitical scientist Janine Parry at the University of Arkansas said Trump Jr.’s use of the term doesn’t \"pass the smell test\" for two reasons.\n\nFirst, \"declaring someone ‘totally unprepared’ for the job is the opposite of an endorsement by any definition,\" Parry said. \"A close second is bin Laden’s stated goal that a Biden presidency would lead the U.S. into a crisis. This, too, is the antithesis of an endorsement by any standard.\"\n\nThrough a political-science lens, bin Laden’s words don’t constitute an endorsement.\n\n\"To be persuasive, endorsements need to come from endorsers who are both knowledgeable and trustworthy,\" Hofstra University political scientist Craig Burnett said. \"I strongly suspect that, for most people, bin Laden fails on both counts.\"\n\nTrump Jr.’s statement, reinforced by the campaign ad, makes the further stretch that bin Laden was somehow weighing in on the choice between Trump and Biden. Bin Laden has been dead for nine years. If creating a crisis in the U.S. was his goal, we can’t know which candidate in 2020 he would prefer.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump Jr. said bin Laden endorsed Biden. Bin Laden said Biden was unprepared for the presidency. That is the exact opposite of an endorsement.\n\nWe rate this claim False.",

          "title": "Joe Biden called for limits on fracking, not a ban",
          "text": "Paul Junge — one of several Republican candidates looking to unseat U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly — touts fracking as a boon to Michigan’s economy and is attacking Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for his stance on the energy extraction method.\n\nOn his campaign website, Junge claims \"moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years.\"\n\nHydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" is a method of releasing oil and gas from shale rock underground by injecting water, sand and chemicals. It has provided an economic boost for some areas of the Midwest, but environmental officials and advocates are concerned about its impact on local water supplies, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMichigan, home to the large Antrim Shale formation, has not seen significant uptake of fracking activity. Voters may have a chance to decide whether it can continue at all if advocates of a fracking ban succeed in reviving a proposed ballot initiative. Polls suggest voters are divided on the issue.\n\nMany Democrats have been critical of fracking on environmental grounds and call for a shift away from fossil fuels, but Junge, a former TV news anchor, exaggerates both Biden’s position on fracking and the impact banning fracking would have on Michigan’s economy.\n\nJoe Biden’s position on fracking\n\nWhile Biden has called for a ban on new permits for fracking on federal land and waters, he has not supported a ban on fracking on private or state land.\n\nAs evidence for the claim, Junge’s campaign provided the transcript of a March 2020 Democratic debate in which Biden said \"no new fracking,\" and then added, \"no more drilling on federal lands.\"\n\nFollowing the debate, a Biden campaign spokesperson clarified that Biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters. PolitiFact rated a Facebook claim that Biden \"announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration\" as Mostly False.\n\nThe economic impact of banning fracking in Michigan\n\nThe Junge campaign said that a ban on fracking would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that only 1,577 workers in Michigan were employed in natural-gas extraction, oil and gas drilling, and related support activities in 2019.\n\nDavid Foster, a former Energy Department official and distinguished associate at the Washington-based Energy Futures Initiative, notes that the data does not differentiate between fracking and conventional oil and gas production.\n\nA supplemental survey conducted for a report on energy employment in the U.S. that Foster wrote found an additional 1,600 people involved in natural-gas fuels in Michigan. This includes professional services jobs, such as accountants, primarily servicing the oil and gas activities identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nTaken together, the oil and natural-gas sector employs fewer than 3,200 workers in Michigan.\n\nWhile fracking may not employ many workers in the state, home heating needs and energy-intensive manufacturing in Michigan make the state’s economy sensitive to changes in the energy market. Still, it is unlikely a ban on fracking would cost the state’s economy more than 500,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity over the next five years.\n\nThe job- and GDP-loss estimates cited by Junge come from a report by the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\n\nThe institute uses an economic-impact analysis model to measure how employment and economic activity statewide would change as a result of a ban on fracking. The analysis makes several assumptions to arrive at the job and GDP figures.\n\nFirst, it assumes that a ban on fracking would result in higher energy prices for consumers and businesses, forcing them to spend more on energy and less on other items such as household goods or investment. Second, it assumes there won’t be any major structural shift in the U.S. energy market over the next five years except for this increase in energy prices. Third, it assumes the higher prices would create some \"windfall\" effect for select producers, boosting some households’ income and spending power.\n\nBut researchers are skeptical of using such a model to analyze the potential macroeconomic impact of a fracking ban on a state’s economy.\n\nTim Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, believes the institute’s analysis makes unrealistic assumptions that overstate the impact of a ban on fracking.\n\nThe method assumes that neither consumers nor businesses would adapt to any price increases. As Bartik explains, this would mean that \"no one adjusts to the banning of fracking, except that prices go up to allocate the reduced supply of energy, the extra funds spent on energy then apparently disappear to Mars, and this reduction in income, in turn, reduces demand mechanically for all other goods and services.\"\n\nThe authors of the institute report said the economy eventually would adjust to higher prices, but evidence of that adjustment would not appear until several years after a ban.\n\nBy then, they predict, the U.S. economy would tank, suffering more than a 10% reduction to employment and economic output with the loss of 19 million jobs and $7.1 trillion in GDP. Michigan alone would take a five-year hit to its GDP that amounts to a third of its 2019 economic output, they estimate.\n\nThese are \"some incredible numbers,\" Bartik said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nJunge said, \"Even so-called moderate Democrats like Joe Biden have endorsed a ban on fracking, which would eliminate 516,000 Michigan jobs and reduce the state’s gross domestic product by $159 billion over five years.\"\n\nBiden miscommunicated his stance in a debate, but the campaign clarified his position, which the Junge campaign is distorting. Biden supports a ban on new fracking on federal lands and waters, not a total ban.\n\nMeanwhile, the job and GDP loss projections Junge cites come from an analysis that researchers say overstates the impact of a ban on fracking.\n\nThe campaign did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.",

          "text": "The death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police has once again brought the issue of racism to the forefront of global discussion.\n\nIn Milwaukee, as in other cities across Wisconsin and the nation, protesters have called for an end to police brutality and discrimination.\n\nIn a June 14, 2020 interview on WISN-TV’s ‘UPFRONT’ with Adrienne Pedersen, Milwaukee health commissioner Jeanette Kowalik commented on some things the city has done to address racism. When she did, she included this tidbit that might have surprised some viewers:\n\n\"Our health department, our city and our county declared racism as a public health crisis last year.\"\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\nThe claim\n\nWhen asked to back up her claim, Kowalik pointed to a Common Council resolution adopted July 30, 2019 that says \"racism is a public health crisis affecting the entire society.\"\n\nThe resolution commits the city to take action toward \"achieving racial equity\" and suggests efforts to \"address public health disparities due to racial inequities.\" It was signed Aug. 8, 2019 by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.\n\nThe resolution notes that, at the time, the Wisconsin Public Health Association, as well as 24 cities, counties and states in the U.S., had declared racism to be a public health crisis.\n\nA May 28, 2019 CBS News report says Milwaukee was the first city in the United States to declare racism a public health crisis. But that report likely meant to refer to Milwaukee County, which passed its declaration of racism as a public health crisis on May 20, 2019.\n\nAt the time, then-Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele said the resolution was about making a public commitment to taking action. He said every decision across the county should be framed in terms of how to make a difference addressing disparities.\n\nThat covers the city and the county.\n\nAs for the Health Department, Kowalik cited a May 16, 2019 letter she sent to the Common Council that described racism as a public health crisis.\n\nThe significance\n\nDr. David Pate, chair of the school of social work at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, called the declaration \"very significant,\" particularly for Milwaukee, which has repeatedly been cited as one of the most segregated metro areas in the U.S.\n\nPate said one of the main ideas of looking at racism as a public health issue was to first look at \"improving access to health\" by categories like race and gender. He noted that Milwaukee has one of the highest Black mortality rates in the country.\n\nWhite people live an average of 14 years longer than Black people in the city, according to a ProPublica article. And these disparities begin at birth.\n\nThe Black infant mortality rate in Milwaukee was 18.4 deaths per 1,000 births in 2017. The U.S. infant mortality rate for white babies is 4.95 and 11.1 for Black babies.\n\nPate told PolitiFact Wisconsin that Floyd’s death has people aware of \"the idea that there are some issues that we have not dealt with that are systemic.\" The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted some of these disparities — the virus has disproportionately impacted Black populations.\n\nOn June 8, 2020, in the wake of the Floyd protests, the Denver city council declared racism a public health crisis. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh made the same decision four days later.\n\nThe list goes on, as more cities follow the lead of Milwaukee County and the city of Milwaukee.\n\nOur ruling\n\nKowalik said \"Our health department, our city and our county declared racism as a public health crisis last year.\"\n\nAll three bodies did make such a declaration, putting them at the forefront of something that has picked up steam nationwide in the months since.\n\nWe rate this claim True.",

          "text": "The tradition started in 1866 in Texas and spread to nearby states.\n\nDonald Trump said that before he rescheduled a rally in Tulsa, Okla., nobody had heard of Junteenth, a day that marks the end of slavery in America.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took credit for boosting awareness of Juneteenth, a day that marks the end of slavery in America.\n\n\"I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,\" Mr. Trump said, in a Wall Street Journal interview. \"It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.\"\n\nTrump had originally planned his first political rally in more than three months in Tulsa, Okla., for June 19. He moved the rally to June 20 after, he said, African American leaders asked him to.\n\nIt is fair to say that outrage over George Floyd’s death while in police custody, combined with vocal demonstrations and the Black Lives Matter movement, have raised the profile of Juneteenth and its meaning to new heights. Trump’s planned rally in Tulsa fueled that sentiment. But his suggestion that no one knew about it ignores history; the day has held significance for millions of Americans for decades.\n\nJuneteenth stems from June 19, 1865, when Union troops under Gen. Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas. Granger’s men marched through the city reading General Order No. 3 at municipal buildings and churches, declaring that all slaves were now free. African American leaders held the first celebration to mark the day on June 19, 1866.\n\nTrump’s assertion that he made the day famous is a matter of opinion, but we can fact-check his claim that \"nobody had ever heard of it.\"\n\nMillions of Americans had heard of Juneteenth before Trump’s scheduling shift.\n\n\"Today, if Americans have any knowledge at all about commemorations of the end of U.S. slavery, their reference point is generally Juneteenth,\" historian Mitch Kachun wrote in 2007.\n\nIn 1980, Texas made June 19 a state holiday. Today, 47 states recognize the day. New York and Virginia just moved to make it a state holiday.\n\nIn 2019, celebrations were held in cities nationwide, including New York City, Sacramento, Houston, New Orleans, Sioux Falls, S.D., Richmond, Va., Tulsa, Okla., Milwaukee, Kansas City, Mo., and the list goes on and on.\n\nFrom Texas in 1866, the Juneteenth tradition spread to surrounding states. It was popular in Oklahoma, where a young African American writer named Ralph Ellison grew up. Ellison wrote a short story entitled \"Juneteenth.\" It became a key chapter in Ellison’s posthumously published novel bearing the same title.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the social justice overtones of Juneteenth grew more prominent. In 1968, the Poor People’s March on Washington firmly embedded Juneteenth in the Civil Rights movement. The march that traveled through the South had its final day of speeches and music at the Lincoln Memorial before an estimated crowd of 50,000 on June 19, 1968. Juneteenth.com, one of several efforts to promote recognition of the day, tracked large events in Milwaukee and Minneapolis back to the 1968 march.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, books aimed at younger readers popularized the tradition. The head of a group that promoted Juneteenth presented a copy of \"Juneteenth: A Celebration of Freedom\" to then-governor of Alaska Sarah Palin at the Alaska Juneteenth Conference in Anchorage in 2009, where the governor spoke about the significance of Juneteenth in her state.\n\nUnder Trump, the White House has issued statements every year to recognize Juneteenth.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said that nobody had heard of Juneteenth until this year.\n\nThe history is clear. Long before Trump was elected president, millions of Americans knew about the day that marks the end of slavery in America.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.",

But with this post re-circulating, we decided to set the record straight, again.\n\nDifferences Between California’s Primary and General Elections\n\nAccording to the California Secretary of State’s Office, political parties — not state officials — decide whether and how the state’s independent voters, also known as No Party Preference voters, can participate in each party’s presidential primary election.\n\nThe restrictions make it more difficult but not impossible to vote for your favorite candidate. For example, the Democratic party required California’s more than 5 million registered independents to request a \"crossover ballot\" in March to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate. But it did not force them to re-register.\n\nBy contrast, the Republican party required independent voters to register with the GOP to participate in its primary. So, the warning in the first part of the Facebook post was correct — for the March primary.\n\nThese requirements, however, do not apply to California’s November general election.\n\n\"The assertion in that Facebook post is absolutely not true,\" Sam Mahood, spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, wrote in an email this week. \"In a General Election you can vote for any candidate, regardless of the voter’s party.\"\n\nMahood cited California Elections Code section 13206.5, which covers statewide general elections and states:\n\n\"All voters, regardless of the party preference they disclosed upon registration, or refusal to disclose a party preference, may vote for any candidate for a voter-nominated or nonpartisan office.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nA resurfaced Facebook post claims California’s registered independents must re-register as Republicans to vote for GOP candidates \"come 2020.\" It also alleges that California came up with this rule \"hoping no one figures it out in time.\"\n\nThe first part was correct for the March primary. But it doesn’t apply to California’s November general election, when voters can select the candidate of their choice, no matter their party affiliation.\n\nThe second part is false. The political parties, not the state, set the rules for participating in presidential primaries.\n\nThis post was partially-wrong the first time.

We did not hear back.\n\nObama created task force to improve policing, focused on oversight\n\nObama in December 2014, through an executive order, established the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing in the wake of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nThe task force issued its final report in May 2015, after holding public listening sessions across the country and getting testimony and recommendations from community and faith leaders, law enforcement officers, academics, and others.\n\nOne of the recommendations focused on law enforcement policies and community oversight, saying policies must reflect community values and not lead to practices with disparate impacts. Law enforcement agencies should have review boards that look into cases of officer-involved shootings and other serious incidents that can damage community trust or confidence in the agency, the report said.\n\n\"Not only should there be policies for deadly and nondeadly uses of force but a clearly stated ‘sanctity of life’ philosophy must also be in the forefront of every officer’s mind,\" the report said. \"This way of thinking should be accompanied by rigorous practical ongoing training in an atmosphere of nonjudgmental and safe sharing of views with fellow officers about how they behaved in use of force situations.\"\n\nThe report \"still serves as an important playbook for the policing field on where reform should be going,\" said Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nBeyond the task force, the Obama administration also investigated police departments for patterns or practices that violated constitutional or federal rights. Those investigations don’t center on one single incident. They examine broader behavior to determine whether there’s misconduct within a department. The administration also pushed for consent decrees, court-enforced negotiated agreements that specify remedies departments must implement to correct misconduct.\n\nThe notion that the Obama administration didn’t try police reform because they didn’t know what to do is not accurate, said Kennedy, the research center director at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The Obama-era policies were aimed at preventing police violence and police misconduct, improving policing and police-community relations, he said.\n\n\"That was an administration that made these issues a priority,\" said Kennedy, who was part of the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.\n\nPolitiFact tracked more than a dozen promises Obama made about criminal justice, including his pledge to ban racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies. Toward the end of his tenure, we rated that a Compromise, because no related bill passed Congress during Obama's administration, but the Justice Department did overhaul its rules to address racial profiling.\n\nIn 2016, the Justice Department under Obama said it would continue to help implement the task force's findings and train law enforcement agents to recognize and address implicit bias, unconscious or subtle associations that individuals make between groups of people and stereotypes about those groups.\n\nTrump’s claim that Obama and Biden didn’t even try police reforms is \"patently false,\" said Sean M. Smoot, director and chief legal counsel of the Police Benevolent and Protective Association of Illinois and a member of the Obama task force.\n\nThe Obama administration also sought funding for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services within the Justice Department. The office provides police departments technical and training assistance, hiring grants, and also access to mental health and wellness resources. Trump's budget proposals have sought to eliminate the office.\n\n\"Fortunately for the law enforcement field, Congress has rejected those budget requests and continues to fund the COPS office,\" Smoot said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump said, \"President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period.\"\n\nThe record shows that is not true. After the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson and related racial justice protests, Obama established a task force to examine better policing practices. The Obama administration also investigated patterns or practices of misconduct in police departments and entered into court-binding agreements that require departments to correct misconduct.\n\nWe rate Trump’s statement False.",

          "text": "\"The Week in Fact-checking\" compiles short summaries of our best work; the links will take you to our full reports. Want this report early and via email? Sign up here.\n\nThis week: New names for military bases named for Confederates … Can pranksters disrupt Trump’s Tulsa rally? … Oklahoma is not flattening the curve … And the Trump campaign isn’t hiring actors … Fact-checkers under threat in the Philippines … A Pants-on-Fire claim from Trump on COVID-19 testing\n\nHistorians suggest new names for military bases named after Confederates\n\nDespite President Donald Trump’s opposition, momentum is growing to rename 10 military bases that have long been named for Confederates.\n\nThe bases got their names mainly during World War I and World War II, when military officials, under pressure to mobilize larger forces, erected bases in the South and yielded to local politicians’ preferences for names.\n\nMilitary historians queried by PolitiFact gave a long list of potential replacement names, from top generals to African American military pioneers.\n\nThe historians we checked with — who were unanimous that the base names should be changed — offered several categories of historical figures who might be candidates for renamed bases.\n\nThis list of top generals included Lee’s Union rival, Ulysses S. Grant, as well as Dwight D. Eisenhower, George Marshall and George S. Patton from World War II.\n\nAmong African Americans, Martin Delaney was the first black officer during the Civil War, while Christian Fleetwood was a Medal of Honor recipient during the Civil War. And Harriet Tubman served as a spy in the Union army.\n\nOne long-standing proposal has been to rename Ft. Hood for Roy Benavidez, a Texan of Mexican ancestry who served in the Army special forces and who won a Medal of Honor for service in the Vietnam War.\n\nRead our full story for more suggestions the historians offered.\n\n— Louis Jacobson\n\nLook for our coverage of Trump’s Saturday night Tulsa rally. We’ll be fact-checking live via Twitter and writing a story about our findings.\n\nFact-checks of the week\n\nPence wrong on Oklahoma ‘flattening the curve.’ Defending Trump’s decision to hold a rally in Tulsa, Pence said, \"In a very real sense, they’ve flattened the curve. ... The number of cases in Oklahoma — it's declined precipitously.\" We rated that False (and we have charts to prove it). This observation is outdated and inaccurate. In June, Oklahoma’s daily caseload has risen consistently, and to levels higher than at any point in the pandemic.\n\nNo, Trump campaign isn’t hiring actors to come to the rally. A Facebook post claims the Trump campaign is recruiting \"excited and enthusiastic MINORITY actors and actresses\" to appear at his Tulsa rally. Its evidence is a Craigslist ad. Though there has been credible reporting about the role of paid protesters in some political efforts, this Craigslist ad itself is a hoax, and a repeated one. Trump opponents take out the ads as a way of mocking the real campaign. We rated the claim False.\n\nBenghazi’s back? No, Hillary Clinton is not on trial, even though a social media post claims she is: \"Hillary Clinton is on trial for Bengazi (sic) this week.\" We rated that False. A court hearing was held on whether Clinton can be deposed in a lawsuit seeking emails and other records regarding the attack. We don’t know how the legal maneuvering will turn out, but we do know the claim that Clinton is not on trial.\n\nKnowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.\n\nTrump opponents are reserving tickets to his Tulsa rally to leave empty seats. It won’t work\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s reelection campaign says 1 million people have registered for tickets to his June 20 campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., the first since the outbreak of the coronavirus put a halt to large-scale gatherings months ago.\n\nBut some social media users say they bought tickets with no intention of going.\n\nWhat if they \"all went to events.donaldjtrump.com and scooped up all the tickets for the rally in Tulsa so he was speaking to an empty crowd,\" said a June 12 tweet, which was screenshotted and shared on Facebook.\n\nCould anti-Trump protesters really buy up enough tickets to leave Tulsa’s BOK Center mostly empty? It doesn’t seem likely.\n\n\"That is the silliest idea I’ve ever heard,\" said Bob Jack, chairman of the Tulsa County Republican Party.\n\nThe efforts by anti-Trump social media users aren’t likely to work. Even if roughly 98% of the 1 million people who registered to attend plan on skipping the event, there would still be enough people to fill the BOK Center to its 19,000-person capacity.\n\nTrump rallies are often overbooked, with supporters lining up hours in advance to get in. Some people are already waiting outside the BOK Center and on nearby Denver Avenue, local news outlets have reported. Jack said he spoke to one person from Massachusetts who arrived on June 14.\n\nExcept for delegation and party officials, everybody has to get in line, Jack told us.\n\nAlicia Andrews, chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party, told us the state party doesn’t support or encourage registering for the Trump rally with the intention of leaving the seat empty because \"these ‘protest registrations’ only serve to elevate the number of registrations.\"\n\n\"Typically, these rallies are seated on a first-come, first-served basis,\" Andrews said. \"They will not be checking registrations.\"\n\nFinally, health officials have warned that the gathering could spread COVID-19. Bruce Dart, the director of Tulsa’s city and county health department, told the Tulsa World that he wished the campaign would \"postpone this to a time when the virus isn’t as large a concern.\"\n\n— Bill McCarthy\n\nFact-checkers under threat in the Philippines\n\nSince 2017, the Philippines-based Rappler has been considered a respected news organization across the fact-checking community, publishing nonpartisan articles with transparency and thorough methodology.\n\nSo fact-checkers this week responded with a mix of rage and resolve to the guilty verdict given to Maria Ressa, Rappler’s CEO and executive director, and former researcher-writer Rey Santos Jr., in a cyber libel case that threatens press freedom in Asia.\n\nRessa and Santos were considered guilty of libel for an article about Wilfredo Keng, the CEO of a mining company called Century Peak Holdings Corp. According to Rappler’s reporting, Keng had links to illegal drugs and human trafficking and had also lent a car to a top judge.\n\nRessa denied the charges and claimed they were politically motivated. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said the verdict \"basically kills freedom of speech and of the press.\"\n\n\"This is a dark day not only for independent Philippine media but for all Filipinos,\" the group said, according to The New York Times. The Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines described the latest development as \"a menacing blow to press freedom.\"\n\nRead more about the case and fact-checkers’ reactions at Poynter.org.\n\n— Harrison Mantas and Cristina Tardáguila, International Fact-Checking Network\n\nPants on Fire\n\nDo you smell smoke?\n\nHere's your Pants on Fire fact-check of the week:\n\nDonald Trump: \"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\"\n\nYes, he said that. And it’s ridiculously wrong.\n\nSee what else we've rated Pants on Fire this week.",

          "title": "Fact-checking three coronavirus claims from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott",
          "text": "Although infections and hospitalizations connected to the coronavirus are on the rise in Texas, state officials are continuing efforts to reopen parts of the state and allow people to return to their jobs.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott sought to quell fears over the virus during a press conference on Tuesday, pointing to the number of available hospital beds in the state and statistics suggesting that Texas is handling the virus better than other large states.\n\n\"Fewer Texans test positive for COVID-19 than residents of any large state in the United States,\" he said. \"We have the second lowest death rate of the 25 most affected states in America. Only about 10% or even less of Texans who test positive for COVID-19 ever even need to go to the hospital in the first place.\"\n\nWe’ve looked at other statistics about coronavirus in Texas, including the death rate, ages of people dying and recovery figures. But what of Abbott’s latest claims?\n\nAbbott’s office did not return a request seeking additional information about these claims, so we turned to state data published by the Texas Department of State Health Services and data from the COVID Tracking Project, an organization launched by The Atlantic that collects and publishes data from each state’s health agencies on the virus.\n\nAbbott made these claims on June 16, so we will rate them using the information available at the time. It should be noted that these figures are fluid, especially as Texas had seen record hospitalization figures for at least five consecutive days at the time of Abbott’s remarks.\n\n\"Fewer Texans test positive for COVID-19 than residents of any large state in the United States.\"\n\nAbbott did not expand on his comparison and offer specifics on which large states he was measuring against Texas, which is the second most populous state in the country with more than 27.8 million residents.\n\nOne comparison could be between California, Texas and Florida, the only three states with a population of 20 million or more.\n\nOf those states, Florida (with a population of 20.5 million) reported the fewest positive coronavirus cases at the time of Abbott’s remarks in raw numbers, with more than 77,000 positive tests to Texas’ 89,000. California reported more than 151,500 positive tests.\n\nAbbott’s claim is also off if we look at the rate of positive coronavirus test results, as opposed to the raw number of positive results. This rate looks at the percentage of tests administered that come back positive.\n\nUsing this metric, both California (with a population of 39.1 million) and Florida reported a lower positivity rate than Texas. In California, 5.2% of coronavirus tests had come back positive and 5.4% of tests in Florida were positive at the time of Abbott’s remarks. In Texas, the positivity rate was 6.8%.\n\nIf we expand the pool to look at the 10 most populous states, Texas is far from being the state with the fewest positive test results. Of those states, Texas actually reported the fourth highest number of positive test results.\n\nLooking at the positivity rate, Texas has the third lowest of the 10 most populous states — with California and Florida still reporting a lower positive test rate.\n\nWe rate this claim False\n\n\"We have the second lowest death rate of the 25 most affected states in America.\"\n\nLooking at all 50 states and Washington D.C., Texas ranks 43rd in terms of its COVID-19 death rate — the number of fatalities reported vs. the number of positive test results.\n\nAgain, it is not clear which states Abbott considers the \"most affected\" by the coronavirus. We looked at the 25 states with the highest number of positive coronavirus tests and the 25 states with the most fatalities reported to assess this claim.\n\nLooking at the states with the highest positive test results, Abbott is correct: Texas has the second lowest death rate (about 2.2%). Only Tennessee is lower, with a death rate of about 1.5%.\n\nLooking at the states with the most fatalities, Texas has the lowest death rate, followed by North Carolina with a rate of about 2.5% and Virginia at 2.8%.\n\nWe rate this claim True.\n\n\"Only about 10% or even less of Texans who test positive for COVID-19 ever even need to go to the hospital in the first place.\"\n\nIt is difficult to say exactly what percentage of coronavirus cases in Texas have resulted in hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic, as the state does not track cumulative figures for COVID-19 hospitalizations.\n\nState officials produce a daily tally of the number of people currently hospitalized, but if these tallies were totaled, the result would not be an accurate count of the number of people who have ever been hospitalized for the coronavirus — the actual figure would be much lower.\n\nLyndsey Rosales, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said the state does not collect information about when patients were admitted and discharged. This means the daily hospitalization figures could count one person multiple times, if they were in the hospital longer than one day.\n\nBut it is possible to calculate the hospitalization rate for the virus on a given day: by comparing active infections to current hospitalization figures.\n\nThe state produces an estimate of the number of active coronavirus cases \"based on several assumptions related to hospitalization rates and recovery times.\" They calculate the number of recoveries using the same data.\n\nAt the time of Abbott’s remarks, there were an estimated 30,000 active coronavirus infections in the state and about 2,500 people hospitalized — about 8.3% of active cases.\n\nLooking back through available state figures, the percentage of active cases reported as hospitalized on a given day has fluctuated from as high as 16% on some days to as low as 5% on others.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.",

          "title": "Juneteenth: Why one day marking African American freedom rose above others",
          "text": "Juneteenth gained prominence through the Civil Rights movement and the call for economic and social justice.\n\nJune 19 marks the day in 1865 that Union troops landed in Galveston, Texas, and announced the end of slavery.\n\nJuneteenth, a day that speaks to the end of slavery in America, is getting recognition like it’s never seen before.\n\nCompanies from Lyft, to US Bank, to Target, to Google have made June 19 a paid holiday, as has the National Football League. New York and Virginia just moved to make it a state holiday.\n\nPublic celebrations have marked the day for decades, but if 15 years of Google search history is any measure, reactions to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police — and President Donald Trump’s cancelled plan to hold a rally on that day — have sent awareness of Juneteenth skyrocketing.\n\nInterest grew in 2018 and 2019, but the number of people searching the term in 2020 dwarfs all previous years.\n\nBut Trump’s exaggeration in a Wall Street Journal interview that \"nobody had ever heard of it\" ignores history. There is no question the date has held significance for Americans for 155 years.\n\nJuneteenth has been celebrated as a victorious turning point in the emancipation of African Americans, but it has also come to represent something more illustrative about the complex experience of being black in the United States.\n\nEspecially since the Civil Rights movement, the message of Juneteenth has shifted from being a day to celebrate freedom to one that calls people to reflect on the nation’s long history of racial inequality.\n\nThe origins in Galveston, Texas, 1865\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, but it wasn’t until two and half years later that it became a reality in Texas, the last bastion of the Confederacy. On June 19, 1865, Union Gen. Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas. Granger’s men marched through the city reading General Order No. 3 at municipal buildings and churches, declaring that all slaves were now free.\n\n\"The arrival of Gen. Gordon Granger demonstrated that the war was over and the Confederacy was over,\" said Galveston Historical Foundation head Dwayne Jones. \"It was a military act and presence.\"\n\nThe show of force was needed. By some estimates, there were still 250,000 people enslaved in Texas at that point.\n\nLaura Smalley was 10 years old, enslaved on a Belville, Texas plantation, about 120 miles from Galveston on June 19, 1865. In a recorded interview 76 years later, she recalled how the Confederacy’s defeat had not ended slavery for her and her mother. Even after the plantation owner returned from war, Smalley said, he mentioned not a word of freedom while those he enslaved continued unaware.\n\n\"Old master didn’t tell everyone we was free,\" Smalley said. \"He didn’t tell. I think now, he waited six months. ... Six months. And turned us loose on the 19th of June. That’s why you know we celebrate that day, colored folks.\"\n\nLeaders in Galveston’s African American community launched a tradition of public celebrations of June 19, although Jones says newspaper stories at the time didn’t refer to it as Juneteenth. That emerged decades later.\n\nThe day enjoyed popularity mainly in Texas and Oklahoma. Other places marked emancipation on different days. African Americans in Tennessee focused on Aug. 8 in line with stories that President Andrew Johnson freed his slaves in Greenville, Tenn., on that day in 1863. Washington, D.C., observed April 16, the day in 1862 when Congress abolished slavery in the the District of Columbia. For the people of Thomaston, Ga., it was May 29, for reasons similar to those in Galveston.\n\nAs America moved into the new century, some African American leaders argued that celebrating freedom was not enough.\n\nAfrican Americans, a 1913 editorial in the AME Church Review said, \"had been wandering for these past forty years in the wilderness of political serfdom and drinking the bitter water ... of Jim Crowism. Within the next fifty years there must come to the Negro a new emancipation ... from social degradation, industrial and commercial exclusion, political inequality and all discrimination based on race and color.\"\n\nThe Jim Crow practices in the South fell heavily on the public display of African American solidarity. Accessing public spaces for celebration was difficult.\n\nTo pick just one example, in 1930, under pressure from whites, the sheriff in Warrenton, Ga., told African American organizers to \"call it off,\" said historian Mitch Kachun, author of \"First Martyr of Liberty: Crispus Attucks in American Memory.\"\n\nJuneteenth spreads\n\nKachun traced the growing awareness of June 19 to the migration of black people out of the South. By 1920, over 17,000 African American Texans moved away to states from Massachusetts to California. During World War II, thousands more relocated further west to find work in defense industries.\n\n\"As black Texans set down new roots in other regions, they carried along both their struggles for economic and social justice and their Juneteenth traditions,\" Kachun wrote.\n\nThe social justice overtones of Juneteenth became more prominent through the 1950s and 1960s. If any event fused Juneteenth with the Civil Rights movement, it was the 1968 Poor People’s March on Washington.\n\nIn Oklahoma folklore, a black Union soldier traveled by mule to share word of emancipation outward from Texas. The Poor People’s March started hundreds of miles from Washington a few weeks after the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\"Marchers borrowed the widely recognized Juneteenth image of a mule-drawn wagon to deliver their message throughout the South,\" wrote Colgate University historian Graham Hodges. \"Led by a mule, Ralph Abernathy, one of Dr. King's closest assistants conducted the march, stopping at the Lorraine Hotel, where King was gunned down.\"\n\nThe march ended with a ceremony attended by about 50,000 at the Lincoln Memorial on June 19.\n\nJuneteenth.com, one of several efforts to promote recognition of the day, tracked large events in Milwaukee and Minneapolis back to the 1968 march.\n\nThe momentum behind Juneteenth has been growing. In 1980, the Texas legislature made it a state holiday. Today, 47 states recognize the day, although few give state workers the day off. Of those that voted to mark the day, all but four — Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and Minnesota — did so after 2000. There is a long-running effort to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nWhy June 19 over other possible days?\n\nJuneteenth as a widespread celebration was far from inevitable. The people in Texas might have been among the last to be freed, but that turning point was just as powerful in other states, and came at different times.\n\nSome states recognized other dates. America already officially marks emancipation. Years of effort by African American businessman Richard Wright led Congress to designate a National Freedom Day in 1948. It was Feb. 1, the day in 1865 that Lincoln signed the resolution that produced 13th Amendment banning slavery.\n\nBut observance of National Freedom Day foundered. Groundhog Day, which is observed a day later on Feb. 2, tends to get more ink.\n\nMany commentators trace the rising prominence of Juneteenth to how late the news of freedom arrived in Galveston.\n\n\"It is the observance of a victory delayed, of foot-dragging and desperate resistance by white supremacy against the tide of human rights, and of a legal freedom trampled by the might of state violence,\" wrote Vann Newkirk in The Atlantic in 2017.\n\nNewkirk and others see Juneteenth as marking less the fact of liberation and more the unrealized promise of what was supposed to follow. As outrage over the death of George Floyd has swept the nation, the message of Juneteenth resonates.",

          "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden supports studying reparations but hasn’t committed to paying reparations. President Donald Trump opposed the idea in 2019.\n\nThe idea for reparations has gained momentum following George Floyd’s death in May.\n\nSince 1989, Democrats have introduced bills that call for studying reparations for African Americans.\n\nThe latest outpouring of anger and frustration about centuries of systemic racism has renewed calls for reparations for African Americans.\n\nHouse Democrats have introduced bills since 1989 to develop proposals for reparations. But those efforts languished.\n\nNow, supporters of reparations are optimistic about new awareness since the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"This right now is the most attention we’ve ever had in American history on the issue,\" said Justin Hansford, a Howard University law professor.\n\nThe goal of reparations is to acknowledge the nation’s history of white supremacy, the legacy of slavery and their continuing impact on African Americans in all aspects of society, said Kristen Clarke, president of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nIn Congress, legislation to establish a commission to study reparations is on the table:\n\nThe legislation calls for a major study of reparations, but anticipates that if enacted, reparations would likely include a formal apology for America’s history of slavery, as well as compensation to descendants of slaves.\n\nWilliam Darity Jr., a professor of public policy and African American studies at Duke University, testified before a House committee in June 2019 about reparations.\n\n\"The protests galvanized by George Floyd’s murder have activated a discussion of many measures to promote racial justice including reparations for black American descendants of U.S. slavery,\" Darity told PolitiFact.\n\nHistorical efforts to make reparations\n\nThe first federal call for reparations came during the waning months of the Civil War. Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman ordered that formerly enslaved families should get plots of 40 acres along with mules.\n\nBut after President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson reversed Sherman’s order. The phrase \"40 acres and a mule\" would later become a symbol of the nation’s unfulfilled promise.\n\nOver the next century, many activists called for reparations, including Callie House, Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X.\n\nIn 1989, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., introduced a bill to create a commission to study reparations. The bill called for the commission to recommend remedies and consider whether compensation was warranted. The idea for reparations drew more attention following author Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 2014 essay in The Atlantic.\n\nAfter Conyers retired in 2017, Jackson Lee took over the effort. House Resolution 40 lays out the case for reparations, saying that some 4 million Africans and their descendants were enslaved from the time of the American colonies until the end of the Civil War in 1865, and that discrimination continued in various forms for generations.\n\nAfter slavery ended, the bill says, the government perpetuated practices that disadvantaged African Americans, including \"sharecropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system.\"\n\nAs a result, the bill says, African Americans \"continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships,\" including higher unemployment and less wealth than whites.\n\nBill would set up a commission to consider remedies\n\nIf the bill is enacted, a commission comprising 13 members would be appointed within 90 days.\n\nThe president and House speaker would each appoint three members, with the Senate president pro tempore appointing another. The other six members would be selected by organizations that have historically championed reparations.\n\nThe major questions the commission would pursue center on the history of American slavery, the government’s role in discrimination and a redress for past injustices. The commission would hold hearings, gather documents and bring on experts to create a report.\n\nThis process would culminate with the commission recommending \"appropriate remedies\" as part of a report to Congress due within a year, the bill states. H.R. 40 would authorize $12 million to set up the study commission. It’s silent as to how any reparations would be financed.\n\nIncreased calls for reparations amid the protests in 2020\n\nA series of events this year have fueled demands that Congress take steps to address racism, including the death of Floyd, the COVID-19 pandemic and the death of Breonna Taylor, an African American woman who was shot in her home while Louisville police executed a search warrant.\n\nIn June, Robert Johnson, who became America’s first billionaire when he sold BET to Viacom, called for $14 trillion in reparations based on $357,000 for each of 40 million African Americans.\n\n\"Now is the time to go big,\" to keep America from dividing into two separate and unequal societies, Johnson said on CNBC.\n\n\"Wealth transfer is exactly what’s needed,\" he argued. \"Think about this. For 200-plus years or so of slavery, labor taken with no compensation is a wealth transfer. Denial of access to education, which is a primary driver of accumulation of income and wealth, is a wealth transfer.\"\n\nThere are historical precedents for reparations, including in Germany for victims of the Holocaust and in the U.S. for Japanese Americans who were interned in World War II, noted Duke University professor William Darity and his co-author, writer A. Kirsten Mullen, in a June report calling for reparations to individuals.\n\nThe writers called for reparations in the form of money to eliminate the black-white wealth gap, which they called \"the most glaring indicator of racial injustice in America.\"\n\nWhile many proposals for reparations are focused on payments to individuals, another way to achieve reparations would be to provide money to black institutions including universities, churches and hospitals serving black communities.\n\nImpact on the presidential race in 2020\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign plan for black America calls for a study on reparations, but he hasn’t committed to supporting monetary reparations.\n\nDuring an NAACP town hall in June, moderator Ed Gordon asked Biden about that: \"If in fact a calculation comes to you that you are satisfied with, would you then say, ‘I am for reparations?’\"\n\nBiden replied that it \"depends upon what it was, and will it include Native Americans as well.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to our question about Trump’s position on reparations. (The campaign deferred to the White House.) But in June 2019, after a House hearing on reparations, The Hill asked Trump for his opinion.\n\n\"It’s been a very interesting debate,\" Trump said. \"I don’t see it happening, no.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also rejected the idea in 2019.\n\n\"I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none (of) us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\" McConnell said. \"We've tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We elected an African American president.\"\n\nPolls in 2019 showed that a majority of Americans oppose reparations, including most white Americans, while a majority of African Americans supported the idea.\n\nDiscussion of reparations has come up in every Democratic presidential race since 2008. In that year, candidate Barack Obama opposed reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past was to focus on the present and future, including school funding.\n\nIn 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Hillary Clinton called for improving education, providing jobs and addressing poverty in lieu of reparations.\n\nBut during the 2020 primary, many of the candidates called for studying reparations, including Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, two of Biden’s potential vice presidential picks.\n\nBooker, one of the 2020 presidential candidates, filed a reparations bill in the Senate in April 2019, and Harris signed on as a co-sponsor in May 2019, along with Sens. Warren, Sanders and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nHarris told NPR shortly before Booker’s bill was filed, \"I think that the term ‘reparations’ means different things to different people. But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course.\"",

          "text": "• Experts are urging media outlets to continually explain these realities and maintain transparency about the vote count in order to head off conspiracy theories about the validity of the vote.\n\n• Mail ballots usually take longer to count. This could lead to delays in declaring a winner in battleground states in the presidential race, possibly making “election night” more like “election week.”\n\n• The expected increase in voting-by-mail in November is going to pose challenges for how election officials and journalists report the results, and how voters absorb them.\n\nIt’s time to let go of old ideas about how election night will work. This November, there’s a good chance we won’t have a clear winner in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nAmid the coronavirus pandemic, many states are urging residents to vote by mail, and election officials are bracing for a more time-consuming ballot counting process.\n\nBallots cast by mail require extra steps to verify a voter’s identity, such as comparing signatures, and require more mundane handling like opening envelopes and sorting. Their increased use makes it likelier that the candidate who leads early may fall behind once later votes are counted.\n\nElection experts say that everyone — the candidates, the media, and voters watching the results roll in — needs to prepare for the possibility of delayed returns. There will be a lot more to come after Election Day, Nov. 3.\n\n\"It could easily be ‘election week’ rather than election day,\" said John Lapinski, the director of elections at NBC News.\n\nHere’s what you need to know, including some tips to help you keep your expectations in check after the polls close.\n\nWhy mail-in voting could transform election night\n\nConsider this year’s California primary, in which 5.8 million people voted for president. Only 3 million of those ballots were counted by election night; the other 2.8 million votes took an additional seven weeks to count, said John Couvillon, a pollster and political analyst.\n\nCalifornia is a virtual lock for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, so a delay in getting its final results won’t pose too much of an obstacle for calling the presidential race in November.\n\nBut several battleground states have eased rules for voting by mail this year, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire. These are states without a lot of experience overseeing elections with high mail-in ballot participation. Other battleground states also expect to see increases in mail voting.\n\nCollectively, this could produce delays and confusion, with media outlets unable to call enough states to give a presidential candidate at least 270 electoral votes on election night or even into the next morning.\n\nThe delays could be especially noticeable in states that accept ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward. Those states include the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina, as well as California and Texas.\n\nThe verification of provisional ballots, which often includes matching the affidavit signature on the outside of the return envelope against the voter’s signature on record, adds time. Not to mention the time it takes to simply remove ballots from envelopes and stack the ballots.\n\nElection administrators have been pushing for laws that would allow them to start the verification process prior to election night. Many states allow this, as long as the ballots are not counted and the totals are not released until after the polls close.\n\nPennsylvania passed a law in March to allow clerks to start canvassing ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day, rather than waiting until after the polls close. But some election officials have said that isn’t enough time. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said she wants state lawmakers to change the law to allow officials to open ballots three weeks before Election Day. \"That would help tremendously,\" she told the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nIn Ohio, elections officials can start processing, but not tabulating, ballots about one month before Election Day. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said local officials are using creative contraptions — such as dumbbells with plywood — to flatten the ballots so they are less likely to get jammed when they go through the machines. \"They all have some little trick,\" he said.\n\nIn Arizona, a new election law will allow officials to start tallying results, but not posting them, 14 days before Election Day. In Michigan, a state Trump won in 2016 but that is in play for 2020, elections officials must wait until 7 a.m. on Election Day to start processing ballots. A pending bill could move that earlier by one day.\n\nHow long could it take to call a presidential winner? It depends\n\nFor historical perspective, in 2016, the Associated Press, a leader in election calling, declared that Trump had won Pennsylvania at 1:35 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday and that he had won Wisconsin about an hour later at 2:29 a.m. That was enough to put him over 270 electoral votes by early Wednesday morning, recalled Nathan Gonzales, the editor and publisher of Inside Elections.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that the 2020 voting could proceed on a similar track if the election turns out not to be especially tight. \"If it’s not that close, we may be able to discern the presidential winner even if large shares of the vote are still outstanding in key states,\" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nBut Kondik and other election analysts are preparing for a drawn-out election, with threats of litigation potentially drawing out the process.\n\nHow to watch election returns in November 2020\n\nIf you’re someone who enjoys gathering around the TV with your family and friends on election night, there are a few things you should keep in mind before you settle in the night of Nov. 3:\n\nEarly leaders may not ultimately win. The candidate who has the lead early in the night may not win when all votes are counted, due to which ballots happen to be counted first.\n\nIn many cases, rural, more Republican areas with fewer ballots to count tend to be tallied first, while urban, more Democratic areas with heavier ballot loads are counted later. Sometimes, however, it goes the other way; in 2016, the earliest vote counts in North Carolina, Florida, and Ohio favored Hilary Clinton, but she ended up losing all three to Donald Trump.\n\nThese shifts are natural and aren’t \"nefarious,\" experts agree.\n\n\"It just means that different parts of states, with different political and demographic profiles, will be reporting at different points in the process, said Drew McCoy, the president of Decision Desk HQ, which reports election-related data to media outlets, political organizations, and private companies.\n\nBeware of \"percentage of precincts reporting\" numbers. The metric has long been used in TV chyrons and online databases to indicate how much of the vote has been counted. But in an election conducted heavily by mail, the \"precincts reporting\" percentage is almost meaningless. The percentage of precincts counted may be close to 100% yet not take into account a large number of untallied mail ballots. Using the old metric could be highly misleading.\n\n\"We should never see a ‘100% of precincts reporting’ language again when there are thousands of absentee ballots yet to count and include in the totals,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine.\n\nBeware of political spinning. Early leads for one candidate can be hijacked by partisan commentators and then amplified on social media. For instance, more partisan-aligned media outlets may be comfortable \"coloring in\" the map quickly with the leads as they stand, regardless of whether or not the states have counted enough votes to justify a final call, said Edward B. Foley, an election law specialist at Ohio State University.\n\nWidespread sharing of misleading maps on social media could \"generate a narrative that one candidate already has prevailed when, in fact, there are lots of votes still left to count,\" Foley said.\n\nAllowing such claims to spread could damage public trust in the election if the other candidate is ultimately declared the winner, said a panel of election experts chaired by Hasen in a series of recommendations for ensuring public confidence in the 2020 elections.\n\n\"Political leaders should come together and speak out against candidates or groups who declare victory early or raise false claims about ballot tampering,\" the report urged.\n\nBe judicious about your news sources. Seek out political coverage that takes pains to explain the ballot-counting process to voters. For instance, trustworthy media sources will use the phrase \"too early to call.\"\n\nReliable media outlets will also make clear that slow counts or shifts in leads are not a sign of fraud or failed processes, and they will debunk viral misinformation, especially if it’s amplified by political figures.\n\nRick Klein, the political director at ABC News, said he is making these concerns a priority for his network’s election night coverage: \"That's a hard thing to explain to an audience. That part is keeping me up at night.\"\n\nVote early if you can. Voters can help streamline the ballot-counting process by not waiting until the last minute to mail in their ballots, said Matthew Weil, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"When I talk to voters I tell them to do it earlier in the process, so-called ‘flatten the curve’ of absentee voting so we don’t have to overwhelm the system,\" he said.\n\nLearning from California, Oregon and Washington\n\nThere may be lessons in the experiences of states that have become more accustomed to high levels of mail balloting and its resulting delays, such as Oregon and Washington state.\n\nIn Washington, voter irritation with long ballot counts has eased over time, said Russ Walker, the former assistant news director and online managing editor for KING-TV in Seattle.\n\n\"Over the years, most major news organizations arrived at best practices for explaining why some races aren't called on election night,\" Walker said. \"The fact that there was so much reporting about the process every year, it resulted in a fairly consistent no-big-deal tone to coverage.\"\n\nVoters in Washington \"are used to delays in knowing who wins close races,\" added Jim Brunner, who covers politics for the Seattle Times. \"It can be frustrating to wait, and I know partisan activists nationally may try to capitalize on shifting ballot results to raise suspicion about the process. But it’s just the way our system works.\"\n\nIn Oregon, ballots must be received by Election Day, not just postmarked by then. \"In more than 20 years we have had no serious questioning of results,\" said David Sarasohn, a former political columnist with the Oregonian newspaper.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to doing more than just reporting the numbers, but putting them in context, experts say.\n\n\"It’s important for everyone who covers and works in elections to be constantly explaining to the electorate that results may be completed later this year than they usually are, and why that doesn’t necessarily mean something fishy is going on,\" said Kondik of Sabato’s Crystal Ball. \"In our conspiracy-driven political culture, that is a Herculean task, I’m afraid.\"\n\nSamantha Putterman contributed to this article.",

It doesn’t seem likely.\n\nRELATED: Donald Trump had biggest inaugural crowd ever? Metrics don't show it\n\n\"That is the silliest idea I’ve ever heard,\" said Bob Jack, chairman of the Tulsa County Republican Party.\n\nBackground on the rally\n\nThe Trump campaign website says rally goers can request up to two tickets per phone number and that tickets are first-come, first-served. Doors will open four hours before the event.\n\nThe BOK Center, an indoor concert and event venue, can fit roughly 19,000 people, according to the Associated Press. It has canceled all other events through July due to the coronavirus, which experts believe spreads more easily in crowded, contained areas than it does outdoors.\n\nHealth experts have warned about the risks associated with crowds as states have started to reopen. Community spread of the coronavirus has not stopped.\n\nBruce Dart, the director of Tulsa’s city and county health department, told the Tulsa World that he wished the campaign would \"postpone this to a time when the virus isn’t as large a concern.\"\n\nThe rally was originally scheduled to take place a day earlier, on June 19. That date, known as Juneteenth, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. It marks the day in 1865 when Union soldiers told slaves in Texas that the Civil War had ended and they were free.\n\nFacing criticism for holding a rally on Juneteenth and in Tulsa, the site of the 1921 race massacre in which white residents attacked black residents and businesses, Trump tweeted that he was pushing the rally back \"out of respect for this Holiday.\"\n\n...of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2020\n\nDisclaimers on the campaign website say that attendees \"voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19\" and agree \"to receive periodic text messages\" from the campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCould the ticket scheme work?\n\nThe efforts by anti-Trump social media users to leave him with an empty arena aren’t likely to work. Even if roughly 98% of the 1 million people who registered to attend plan on skipping the event, there would still be enough people to fill the BOK Center to its 19,000-person capacity.\n\n\"Let’s say half of the people are fake tickets,\" Jack said. \"We’re still good.\"\n\nTrump rallies are often overbooked, with supporters lining up hours in advance to get in. Some people are already waiting outside the BOK Center and on nearby Denver Avenue, local news outlets have reported.\n\nJack said he spoke to one person from Massachusetts who arrived on June 14.\n\nSupporters for President Donald Trump line up before a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., on March 2, 2020. (AP/McCarn)\n\nDavid McLain, chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party, said in a June 15 news conference that admission would be first-come, first-served. Any attendees in excess of the BOK Center’s capacity would be directed to watch from the nearby Cox Center, he said.\n\n\"I believe it is the intent to fill the BOK up with people,\" McLain said, adding that \"the early bird gets the worm\" and that \"that’s the way that our president has done it in every state.\"\n\nExcept for delegation and party officials, everybody has to get in line, Jack told us.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale previously said on Twitter that the campaign was considering organizing a second event for the city. Oklahoma’s governor has asked the campaign to consider a larger venue, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAlicia Andrews, chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party, told us the state party doesn’t support or encourage registering for the Trump rally with the intention of leaving the seat empty because \"these ‘protest registrations’ only serve to elevate the number of registrations.\"\n\n\"Typically, these rallies are seated on a first-come, first-served basis,\" Andrews said. \"They will not be checking registrations.\"\n\nSocial media users have tried to stage similar disruptions in the past, including when Trump rallied in Topeka, Kan., in September 2018, according to reports.\n\nAfter TV footage showed some empty seats in the stands during an August 2019 campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., Twitter users sent the hashtag #EmptySeatMAGATour to the top of Twitter’s trending topics feed, according to The Hill.

          "title": "Military bases named for Confederates: Renaming suggestions from military historians",
          "text": "• The bases got their names mainly during World War I and World War II, when military officials, under pressure to mobilize larger forces, erected bases in the South and yielded to local politicians’ preferences for names.\n\n• Despite President Donald Trump’s opposition, momentum is growing to rename 10 military bases that have long been named for Confederate figures.\n\nPresident Donald Trump may be opposed to rechristening the 10 U.S. military bases named for Confederate figures, but the idea is getting a serious look from top military brass and lawmakers\n\nWe wondered why the bases have these names in the first place, so we checked with eight military historians. The historians were unanimous that the base names should be changed, and they offered a panoply of possible honorees. (Here’s a full list of the 10 bases and their current namesakes.)\n\nWhy were these bases named for Confederate generals in the first place?\n\nAn irony is that, except for Gen. Robert E. Lee, most of these Confederate generals \"were undistinguished, if not incompetent, battlefield commanders,\" David Petraeus, the former Army general and CIA director, wrote recently in the Atlantic.\n\nThe naming of bases after Confederates stems from both prosaic and weightier factors, historians said.\n\nThe base namings came first during World War I and then during World War II. In both cases, the military was scrambling to ramp up its forces after peacetime lulls. And at the time, the South offered the fastest path for expansion.\n\nIn this context, getting the political support of local politicians by choosing a name they liked \"was paramount,\" said Lance Janda, a Cameron University historian. In the South, the military often took its cues from local and state politicians, historians said.\n\nThe timing of when these bases were named was not coincidental, historians said. It was after Union soldiers who would have opposed the names had died and before the advent of the civil rights movement, when harsh segregation was still in effect in the South.\n\nBy World War I, officials had pretty much decided that reconciliation between the North and South \"was more important that the rights of freed African Americans, which led, among other things, to the unhindered establishment of Jim Crow in the South,\" said David Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of \"War Of Frontier And Empire.\"\n\nDuring that period, the status quo was an \"imperfect peace\" that was \"predicated on rewriting the narrative of the Civil War with emancipation, black participation, and black concerns edited out,\" said Gregory J. W. Urwin, a Temple University historian and author of \"Black Flag Over Dixie: Racial Atrocities and Reprisals in the Civil War.\"\n\nThe military in particular was thoroughly segregated through World War II. \"White Southerners filled the officer corps and the enlisted ranks, and they brought their neo-Confederate culture with them,\" Urwin said.\n\nAll in all, the base namings happened \"during the height of the rise of America’s apartheid,\" said Le’Trice Donaldson, an assistant professor of social science at the University of Wisconsin-Stout and author of \"Duty Beyond the Battlefield: African American Soldiers Fight for Racial Uplift, Citizenship, and Manhood, 1870-1920.\"\n\nAn oil painting of Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, Pa., from a position on the Confederate line looking toward the Union lines. (Library of Congress)\n\nWhat’s the argument for changing the bases’ names?\n\nOn the most basic level, military historians say, Confederates were disloyal.\n\n\"I do not think it morally defensible that any U.S. soldier, regardless of region, race, creed, or gender should be forced to serve on a base named for a self-proclaimed enemy of the United States who was directly responsible for killing thousands of their comrades,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M historian and author of \"The Echo of Battle: The Army’s Way of War.\"\n\nJanda agreed. \"I have never understood naming the bases after traitors, men who betrayed their country and bore arms against the United States,\" he said. \"The men for whom all 10 bases were named have that in common.\"\n\nOn a more practical level, people of color account for a disproportionate percentage of the present-day military, so having bases named after defenders of the Confederacy, and slavery, shows a particular brand of insensitivity.\n\n\"It’s something I think white people are not as sensitive to — how much of an insult this is,\" said Richard Kohn, a University of North Carolina historian and author of \"Military Laws of the United States, from the Civil War through the War Powers Act of 1973.\" \"It’s time to move on.\"\n\nConfederates, Silbey said, \"fought to protect an utterly repugnant system that enslaved millions of Americans in the worst kind of horror. We can remember that history without honoring that history.\"\n\nThat said, it’s important to make changes within a context of educating service members about the reasons, Urwin said.\n\n\"A disproportionate number of service personnel are whites from the South and other rural areas of the U.S.,\" Urwin said. \"I doubt that most of them know much about the people for whom most Army posts are named. Nevertheless, name changes should be accompanied by thorough education sessions that demonstrate the changes are consistent with current Army values.\"\n\nWIthout such precautions, he said, \"you could foster considerable resentment and encourage the rise of an underground neo-Confederate cult.\"\n\nBrig. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Sr. watches a Signal Corps crew erecting poles in France on Aug. 8, 1944. (National Archives)\n\nWhat figures might be strong candidates for names on these bases?\n\nThe historians we checked with offered several categories of historical figures who might be candidates for renamed bases. Some of the figures below are still living, so for them, a naming might need to be posthumous.\n\nSenior commanders\n\nThis list of top generals could include Lee’s Union rival, Ulysses S. Grant, as well as Dwight D. Eisenhower, George Marshall and George S. Patton from World War II.\n\nGeorge H. Thomas was a Virginian who, unlike the Confederates honored today, remained with the Union in the Civil War and became a senior commander, including leading a number of black troops at the Battle of Nashville. Robert Gould Shaw, a privileged white Bostonian, gave his life while leading a black regiment in the Civil War. (The 1989 movie \"Glory\" told his story.)\n\nAnd John J. Pershing commanded an African American \"Buffalo Soldiers\" unit in the 1890s.\n\nAfrican American military pioneers\n\nThe patterns of base namings \"certainly reflected a disregard for the historical contributions of black soldiers in the Civil War and the more immediate presence of black soldiers in the World War I and World War II military,\" said Chad Williams, professor of history and African and African American Studies at Brandeis University and author of \"Torchbearers of Democracy: African American Soldiers in the World War I Era.\"\n\nHenry Ossian Flipper and Charles Young were among the first black West Point graduates. Martin Delaney was the first black officer during the Civil War, while Christian Fleetwood was a Medal of Honor recipient during the Civil War. And Harriet Tubman served as a spy in the Union army.\n\nBenjamin O. Davis Sr. became the first African American general in the U.S. Army in 1940, and his son Benjamin O. Davis Jr. commanded the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American pilots. Julius W. Becton Jr. is a three-star general who served in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. Roscoe Robinson Jr. was the first African American to become a four-star Army general; he commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg.\n\nColin Powell became the first African American to chair the Joint Chiefs of Staff after being nominated by President George H.W. Bush.\n\nIndividuals who helped desegregate the military\n\nMatthew Ridgway headed the United Nations Command during the Korean War and took steps to implement President Harry S. Truman's 1948 executive order to integrate the armed forces.\n\nTruman himself served as an artillery captain during World War I, which could qualify him for the honor of having a base named in his honor. Truman \"was descended from Confederate veterans, but rose above that,\" Urwin said. \"In many ways, he modeled the kind of behavior that the Army encourages.\"\n\nMilitary pioneers who were women or members of other ethnic groups\n\nMary Edwards Walker was a Civil War surgeon who received the Medal of Honor. Anna Mae Hays became the first female general in the Army in 1970. Ann Dunwoody became the first four-star female general in the Army in 2008. Daniel K. Inouye, later a senator, was a Medal of Honor recipient in Italy in World War II while serving in a segregated Asian-American unit.\n\nTibor Rubin was a Hungarian Jew who was liberated from a concentration camp by U.S. soldiers, emigrated to the United States, joined the Army, served in Korea, and survived as a prisoner of war; he was awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nEnlisted personnel\n\nHistorically, bases have been named largely after generals, ignoring enlisted service members.\n\nOne longstanding proposal has been to rename Ft. Hood for Roy Benavidez, a Texan of Mexican ancestry who served in the Army special forces and who was awarded a Medal of Honor for service in the Vietnam War.\n\nOne of the most decorated soldiers of World War II was Audie Murphy, who began as an enlisted man and received a battlefield promotion to officer.\n\nMedal of Honor recipients\n\nIn the states with bases named after Confederates, there have been 15 medal of honor recipients from Alabama, 13 from Georgia, 31 from Virginia, 12 from North Carolina, 47 from Texas, and 15 from Louisiana who served in the U.S. Army or U.S. Army Air Corps. \"Any of them would be deserving,\" Janda said.\n\n\"Changing the names should be seen as a wonderful opportunity and not some kind of damaging revisionism,\" he said. \"The truth is that most military bases are temporary, and a lot of them were closed or had their names changed during the last Base Realignment and Closing Commission. What we have now is a chance to have a meaningful discussion about who we honor and how and where we honor them.\"\n\n------------------------------------\n\nBases named for Confederates\n\nIn the South, where the Confederacy was based, 10 bases have been named after Confederates. Some of the forts on this list are among the biggest and most important domestic bases, including Fort Benning, Fort Bragg, and Fort Hood.\n\n• Camp Beauregard, La., named for Confederate Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. Named during World War I.\n\n• Fort Benning, Ga., named for Confederate Gen. Henry Lewis Benning. Named during World War I.\n\n• Fort Bragg, N.C., named for Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg. Named during World War I.\n\n• Fort Gordon, Ga., named for Confederate Lt. Gen. John Brown Gordon. Named during World War II.\n\n• Fort A.P. Hill, Va., named for Confederate Lt. Gen. Ambrose Powell Hill. Named during World War II.\n\n• Fort Hood, Texas, named for Confederate Maj. Gen. John Hood. Named during World War II.\n\n• Fort Lee, Va., named for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Named during World War I.\n\n• Fort Pickett, Va., named for Confederate Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett. Named during World War II.\n\n• Fort Polk, La., named for Confederate Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk, who was killed in action in Georgia. Named during World War II.\n\n• Fort Rucker, Ala., named for Confederate Col. Edmund W. Rucker. Named during World War II.",

          "text": "Citing phony evidence and unsubstantiated reports, state Sen. Amanda Chase recently alerted her constituents to arm themselves against violent protestors she said were coming to Chesterfield County.\n\n\"Stay awake, stay alert. If you own a gun, keep it next to your bedside tonight,\" Chase, R-Chesterfield, said in a Facebook video on June 1, after Richmond had seen three nights of sometimes violent protest in the wake of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd.\n\nChase repeatedly said that evening that she was working with Chesterfield police to protect citizens. Her Facebook warnings received thousands of views, prompting the police to issue statements telling residents Chesterfield was calm and to only trust information they posted. The next day, Chesterfield Police Chief Jeffrey Katz disassociated himself from Chases’ actions.\n\nPolitiFact Virginia examined Chase’s warnings of riot that never came. We reached out to Chase, the only announced Republican candidate for governor next year and a staunch defender of gun rights and preserving Confederate statues. She texted her campaign manager would contact us. As of this writing, he hasn’t.\n\nHere’s the chain of events:\n\nMay 31\n\nChase’s first warning came late on May 31, when Richmond was under curfew after previous nights of protests resulted in fires, smashed windows and pandemonium.\n\n\"You ALL need to guard your families and homes tonight. This is serious and I don’t want you to be caught off guard,\" she wrote in a 10:34 p.m Facebook post. She shared two images which turned out to be bogus.\n\nOne was a tweet from a group calling itself \"ANTIFA America.\" Adorned with flames, it said, \"Tonight’s the night Comrades. Tonight we say ‘F_ _ k The City’ and we move into the residential areas...the white hoods...and we take what’s ours.\"\n\nAntifa is a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing, anti-fascist activists. It has no leaders and is organized into autonomous local groups. The movement has participated in several protests across the country in recent years, including the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there is no national organization for antifa, which means there is no official Twitter account for the movement.\n\nTwitter quickly pulled down the ANTIFA America account, identifying it the next day as a sham organization linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa\n\nThe second image was a Facebook post from the purported group Blacklivess (sic) Matter.\"\n\n\"WE WILL BE ASSASSINATING WHITE FAMILIES UNTILL [sic] JUSTICE IS SERVED!!!\" the post read. \"WE WILL SET UP IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS AND CITIES. ITS TIME TO TAKE ACTION!!!!! ALL WHITE PEOPLE MUST PAY FOR THIER (sic) SINS. THEY ARE EVIL AND JEALOUS HUMAN BEINGS. LETS SEE YOU MOURN OVER YOUR UNCOOKED DISEASE HAVING FAMILIES FOR ONCE. WHITE BABIES, OLD WHITE PEOPLE, LAWYERS, POLICE, ETC!! P.S. THERE ARE OVER 100 OF US THE MISSION WILL BE DONE!!!!\"\n\nProperly spelled, Black Lives Matter is the name of a racial justice campaign with chapters in the U.S. and Canada. It is not connected to the misspelled Facebook account Blacklivess Matter that called for random killing. Facebook revoked that account for being fake.\n\nNeither image mentioned Chesterfield. Chase localized a hoax that created fear in a number of small cities and suburbs across the nation.\n\nChase also shared a screenshot from the Facebook page of the Anti-Fascists of the Seven Hills, a real group of self-proclaimed \"communists and anarchists\" organizing in Richmond. ASH had posted a picture of a burning car, and wrote \"Rebellion is wild and beautiful and fallible and necessary.\" The post, however, didn’t mention Chesterfield or call for violence against whites; nor did any post on the group’s page during the previous week.\n\nJune 1\n\nChase returned to Facebook on June 1, speaking in a video she posted at 4:37 p.m.\n\n\"I actually spoke with Chesterfield County Police Chief Katz and just wanted to make aware to you all what is coming to Richmond,\" she said. \"First of all, it is conclusive that antifa has been in the Richmond area. They’re now going into - this evening - greater Richmond area neighborhoods. I know Chesterfield County, where I live, is one of those targets.\"\n\nChase said antifa would be organizing on the Hull Street and Iron Bridge Road corridors, and in Mechanicsville. Chase did not identify the source of her information, but said three times during the four-minute video that Chesterfield’s police department was aware of the peril.\n\nShe said a network of citizen lookouts had been deployed. Three times, she urged gun owners to be prepared.\n\nAt 5:37 p.m., the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense league issued an alert on its website: \"ANTIFA has made a threat to attack neighborhoods and stores in Chesterfield County, including in the area of the John Hancock center around (Virginia Route) 360 and Winterpock roads tonight, June 1. We have reason to believe this threat is one to take seriously.\"\n\nThe group urged its Chesterfield members to watch their neighborhoods and report threats to the police. It warned members against vigilantism, but added, \"if you find yourself in a life or death situation, as always, you should be prepared to protect yourself.\"\n\nOne website reader asked VCDL President Philip Van Cleave for the source of his information. \"Two trusted sources in a position to know,\" Van Cleave said. \"Sorry, I cannot go further than that.\"\n\nAt 6:20 p.m., Chase posted another video, warning of danger and again saying she was working with the county police, as well as the VCDL and retired law enforcement officials. She said of antifa, \"They like to light things on fire - cars, property, houses...They also fill water bottles with acid and like to throw it at people...They throw bricks into windows.\"\n\nChase also said, \"I just want to alert citizens tonight that if you are a 2nd Amendment supporter and you know how to protect yourself and you’re trained, please be alert tonight.\"\n\nHer website is followed by 95,200 people. That night, many thanked Chase for her warnings, said they had firearms ready, and promised to support her for governor. Some reported seeing suspicious vehicles or groups of people. There was also pushback. Some accused Chase of spreading fear and posted an NBC story - published at 7 p.m. - revealing the white nationalist origins of the antifa hoax sweeping the country.\n\nAt 9:04 p.m., the Chesterfield police department tried to quell the stir with a post on its Facebook page. It said there was no unrest in the county and that citizens seeking updates should rely on the department’s website.\n\nKatz amplified that message the next day, saying people seeking information on threats should \"only\" rely on the department’s social media. \"We cannot confirm validity from any other sources‬,\" he posted on the police Facebook page.\n\nDuring a June 3 news conference, Katz denied Chase’s implication that he was the source of her antifa information. Katz acknowledged they had a phone conversation on July 1.\n\n\"At no time did I share any criminal intelligence information with her,\" he said. \"It’s not my practice, it’s not my policy and I’m not in a position to activate any community whatsoever. I’m responsible for the Chesterfield County Police Department and politicians are responsible for their messages and that’s all I have to say.\"\n\nFinal words from Chase\n\nAlthough Chase would not give an interview for this story, she discussed her actions during a June 5 interview on conservative Newsradio WRVA. She contradicted her June 1 post that there was \"conclusive\" evidence antifa was targeting Chesterfield.\n\n\"We had reports, credible or not, that we could not substantiate, that antifa was going to come to our neighborhood and destroy property,\" she said. \"It was unconfirmed, and we were working behind law enforcement.\"\n\nChase said her warnings scared antifa. \"I am so glad I put the message out in Chesterfield and said, ‘you’re not welcome here,’ because, if I hadn’t, they would have been here,\" she said. \"You can guarantee they would have been here.\"\n\nAnd she vowed not to change her ways.\n\n\"I get criticized all the time about the videos I put up on my Sen. Amanda Chase page,\" she said. \" You know what, I’m going to continue to do them. I’m going to inform the citizens of Virginia and my district about what’s going on.\"",

          "text": "Trump said that to a lot of people “defunding the police” means breaking up police forces or not giving them any money. Some do mean that, but others speak about reallocating some police funds to other community services.\n\nTrump said the “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” phrase has two meanings. However, it’s tied to a Miami police chief who in 1967 said he didn’t mind being accused of police brutality.\n\nTrump said Christians thought his Bible photo op was “beautiful.” He leaves out that many Christians condemned the photo op and said he used the church and holy book as a prop.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in a Fox News interview criticized local officials who he believes have lost control of protesters, defended his controversial tweet that evoked use of excessive force by police and stood by his decision to stage a Bible-hoisting photo op at a church in Washington, D.C.\n\nHost Harris Faulkner told Trump he frightened a lot of people with his May 29 tweet saying, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" in reference to demonstrations after George Floyd’s killing by a white police officer. Trump said he heard the expression over the years, attributing it to a police commissioner and mayor in Philadelphia in the 1960s and 1970s. Faulkner pushed back on that, saying it’s linked to a police chief in Miami who didn’t care if his officers’ actions were considered police brutality.\n\nPolitiFact listened to Trump’s Fox News interview and found that he left out important context in several of his claims, including the one about looting and shooting. Here’s a recap.\n\nSays the \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" phrase \"means two things, very different things. One is, if there’s looting, there’s probably going to be shooting, and that’s not as a threat, that’s really just a fact, because that’s what happens. And the other is, if there’s looting, there’s going to be shooting.\"\n\nIn 1967, as civil rights protests swept the country, Miami police chief Walter Headley vowed to crack down on young African American men who he said \"have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.\" There had been a series of robberies in the African American community of Liberty City.\n\nHeadley at a December 1967 press conference said, \"We don't mind being accused of police brutality. They haven't seen anything yet.\"\n\nHe added: \"We haven't had any serious problems with civil uprising and looting because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nIn his book \"Resolving Racial Conflict,\" Colgate University political scientist Bertram Levine wrote that \"a variety of sheriffs and police chiefs\" around the country picked up the slogan.\n\nGarth Pauley, professor of communications at Calvin University, said the phrase aimed to instill fear in African Americans. Trump’s use of the slogan retains that power, Pauley said, \"while simultaneously communicating a tough, law-and-order ethos to his supporters.\"\n\n— Jon Greenberg\n\nRELATED: From Miami '67 to Donald Trump 2020: The history of 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts'\n\nSpeaking about a Bible photo op at St. John’s Church in Washington, D.C., \"I think Christians think it was a beautiful picture.\"\n\nChristians are not a monolith, and many church leaders spoke out against Trump's pose.\n\nBackground on the photo op: On June 1, Trump walked out of the White House and across Lafayette Square to go stand outside St. John’s Church, an Episcopal parish damaged by protesters. When he got there, he was handed a Bible. He posed for pictures with the Bible, at one point raising it with his right hand. Before he got there, federal officers used pepper balls containing a chemical irritant to forcibly clear out protesters from the area around the church.\n\nNo one associated with St. John’s Church was present or informed of the president’s plans. The Rev. Mariann Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, told the Washington Post she was \"outraged\" and that the church was used \"as a prop.\"\n\nPresiding Bishop Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal Church, tweeted that Trump \"used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes.\" In a time of pain, Curry said, \"his action did nothing to help us or to heal us.\"\n\nLeaders of other Christian churches criticized the move. So did leaders of the Wheaton College Billy Graham Center, writing in a June 2 post for Christianity Today: \"America is burning. We need a call to justice that sees each and every person as image bearers of their Creator—as the Bible teaches. But, we did not need that photo op.\"\n\nThe American Bible Society, a nonprofit that seeks to increase access to the Bible, in a blog post the day after Trump’s photo op, said that the Bible has been an important part of the American experience, especially in times of crisis, but cautioned against misusing it.\n\n\"In this time of pandemic fear and social isolation, in this time of racial injustice and senseless violence, in this time of economic uncertainty and generational pain. We should be careful not to use the Bible as a political symbol, one more prop in a noisy news cycle,\" wrote Whitney T. Kuniholm, who serves on the senior leadership team at the American Bible Society. The post did not mention Trump.\n\nTrump allies and evangelical leaders supported his move.\n\nFranklin Graham, who leads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, in a June 3 Facebook post said he appreciated Trump’s action. \"I’m not offended that he held up the Bible — as a matter of fact, I was encouraged!\" Graham wrote. People who said Trump should have prayed at the church \"are nitpicking his gesture,\" he said.\n\nRobert Jeffress, a Dallas megachurch pastor, told The Atlantic he thought \"it was completely appropriate for the president to stand in front of that church.\"\n\n\"And by holding up the Bible, he was showing us that it teaches that, yes, God hates racism, it’s despicable — but God also hates lawlessness,\" Jeffress said.\n\n— Miriam Valverde\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (AP/Patrick Semansky)\n\nRELATED: Barr says federal police didn’t use chemical irritants to clear area by DC church. They did\n\n\"‘Defunding’ to a lot of people means break up the police forces, and either that or don't give them any money, so essentially they are breaking it up.\"\n\nPeople protesting police brutality are calling for overhauls in law enforcement, including a demand to \"defund the police.\"\n\nSome protesters do want to eliminate police departments entirely. Others want to reduce the types of calls that officers respond to and reallocate police funding toward other community services.\n\nKailee Scales, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said the group was calling for a \"divestment in police in order to support more teachers, mental health and restorative services, community resilience departments, social workers, and government resource liaisons.\"\n\n— Miriam Valverde\n\nRELATED: ‘Defund the police’ movement: What do activists mean by that?\n\n\"I think I’ve done more for the black community than any other president, and let’s take a pass on Abraham Lincoln, cause he did good although it’s always questionable, you know in other words, the end result.\"\n\nTrump’s sweeping statement overstates his standing within history.\n\nAfrican American unemployment levels hit all-time lows on his watch, he signed a bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill, and he sought and signed double-digit funding increases for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nHowever, there were several other presidents who worked to improve the lives of African Americans during their tenure beyond Abraham Lincoln, who prosecuted the Civil War and pushed the constitutional amendments that ended slavery.\n\nSecond only to Lincoln, historians say, is President Lyndon B. Johnson, who fought for and signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, two of the most far-reaching laws passed in the 20th century. Johnson, a skilled legislator from his years in the Senate, deliberately crafted his agenda and pushed it through Congress with personal persuasion, to a far greater degree than Trump has, historians say.\n\nJeffrey A. Engel, director of Southern Methodist University’s Center for Presidential History, told us last year that a good way to compare the presidents on race is to gauge whether they are \"ahead of their times\" or \"behind their times.\"\n\nEngel said Johnson and President Harry Truman, who moved to desegregate the military, were ahead of their times, while President Woodrow Wilson was behind his, reversing some earlier policies that had banned discrimination in federal hiring.\n\n\"Trump in this sense is way behind the times,\" Engel said. \"We have not had presidents since Ronald Reagan that so openly used race as a political weapon. Trump is blunt well beyond the norms of his time.\"\n\n— Louis Jacobson",

          "title": "Fact check: Trump's Tulsa rally littered with familiar false claims",
          "text": "(CNN) In his first rally in more than three months , President Donald Trump repeated a bunch of false claims he has made before. Trump's return to the rally circuit, in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, arena that was not full, featured familiar inaccurate accusations about Democratic opponent Joe Biden , about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic , about health care and a variety of other subjects.\n\nIn a speech that lasted for more than an hour and forty minutes, Trump also called for the burning of the US flag to be illegal, claimed victory over a recent loss in the Supreme Court, and spent 10 minutes on a story about walking down a ramp.\n\nHere's a look at what Trump got wrong.\n\nWest Point ramp\n\nTrump engaged in an extensive discussion of his recent speech at West Point on June 13, and his careful descent down a ramp afterward.\n\nThe President explained that the reason he was so careful walking down the ramp was that he was wearing \"leather bottom shoes\" and worried that he might slip due to the lack of traction.\n\nAt one point during his explanation Saturday night, Trump repeated the claim he made on Twitter June 13 that he ran down the ramp for the final 10 feet.\n\nFacts First: It's not true that Trump ran for the final 10 feet of his descent down the ramp on June 13.\n\nVideo shows that Trump walked slowly for almost all of the descent, then slightly picked up the pace for the final three steps or so . (Ran is also a stretch, but we'll let that slide.) This all might appear trivial, but Trump's halting descent fueled questions about his health and it was yet another example of Trump trying to deceive Americans about facts they could see with their own eyes.\n\nJudicial appointments\n\nTrump said in Saturday's rally that the US will have \"close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved\" by the end of his first term as President.\n\nFacts First: While we don't usually check promises, here's the context for Trump's claim.\n\nAccording to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, Trump had gotten 198 judges confirmed as of June 12. Wheeler told CNN: \"If the Senate confirms all 43 pending nominees AND he nominates and the Senate confirms judges to the 30 current vacancies that have no nominees AND 29 additional vacancies occur by the end of the year and he submits nominees for all of them and the Senate confirms then, ONLY then\" will he have appointed a record 300 judges.\n\nCoronavirus travel restrictions\n\nTrump said he shut down the United States to \"all people from China\" and later, \"closed it down to Europe.\"\n\nFacts First: Trump was exaggerating or speaking too broadly.\n\nTrump never imposed a complete \"ban\" on European nationals or people traveling from Europe. Rather, he imposed restrictions on travel from most European countries -- but exempted other European countries. Furthermore, the travel restriction policy his administration announced January 31, which took effect February 2, was not a complete ban on China or a total border closure.\n\nIt prohibited most people who had been in China in the previous 14 days from entering the US, but it made significant exceptions -- for not only US citizens but permanent residents, many of the family members of citizens and permanent residents, and some other groups of people. The New York Times reported April 4 that nearly 40,000 people had flown to the US from China since the restrictions went into effect in early February.\n\nAnd his restrictions on Europe did not apply to some people traveling from there: US citizens, permanent US residents, certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents, and some other groups of travelers. Trump's restrictions initially applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks. Trump later added the United Kingdom and Ireland. That still left out some European countries, including Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and Russia.\n\nVA Choice\n\nThe President claimed his administration was responsible for passing VA choice, which provided the Department of Veterans Affairs more resources to improve access for veterans and allow them to seek care from non-VA providers.\n\nTrump later added to the falsehood, saying \"for decades and decades they wanted to get it done.\"\n\nFacts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by Senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by Senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the Choice program.\n\nNFL commissioner\n\nTrump feigned confusion about the timing of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's June 5 video statement condemning racism, saying nobody was even asking for it.\n\nFacts First: It's not true that nobody was asking Goodell to make such a statement; prominent NFL players, among others, had pressured him to do so. In fact, Goodell's statement included, : It's not true that nobody was asking Goodell to make such a statement; prominent NFL players, among others, had pressured him to do so. In fact, Goodell's statement included, word for word , two of the sentences that a group of players had said that they wanted to hear the NFL say: \"We, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people\" and \"We, the National Football League, believe that black lives matter.\"\n\nBiden apology\n\nTrump claimed in Saturday's rally that Biden apologized for criticizing Trump's travel restrictions on China.\n\n\"When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus,\" Trump said. \"Joe Biden opposed my decision and called it hysteria. Xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means. Xenophobia. And fear mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong. But he didn't say it.\"\n\nFacts First: Biden's campaign Biden's campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump's travel restrictions on China. But neither Biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of Trump. The campaign says that the Biden comments Trump has described as criticism of the China restrictions -- in which Biden said Trump has a record of \"hysterical xenophobia\" and \"fear mongering\" -- were not about the travel restrictions at all.\n\nThe campaign says Biden did not know about the China restrictions at the time of the January 31 speech in which he made these remarks, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the briefing during which the China restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it's not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that Biden was talking about the travel restrictions.\n\nBut Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support -- and whether or not you accept his campaign's argument that the \"xenophobia\" claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn't apologized.\n\nDemocrats and borders\n\nTrump claimed Biden and the Democrats \"want open borders.\"\n\nFacts First: Prominent Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.\n\nWhile Biden has proposed a liberalization of immigration policy, including a moratorium on deportations for his first 100 days in office and taking in more refugees, he is not proposing to allow people to walk across the borders unfettered. His immigration plan says, \"Like every nation, the U.S. has a right and a duty to secure our borders and protect our people against threats.\" In 2019, Biden explicitly opposed Democratic opponents' proposals to decriminalize the act of crossing the border illegally, saying , \"It's a crime.\"\n\nThough the Democratic majority in the House opposes Trump's signature proposal for a border wall, congressional Democrats have long supported other border security measures.\n\nPre-existing conditions\n\nDuring the rally, Trump told the crowd that his administration would protect those with pre-existing health conditions.\"We'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions always, always,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is misleading. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.\n\nRead a full fact check here\n\nIran and the $150 billion\n\nTrump also claimed Saturday that Obama \"gave [Iran] $150 billion dollars\" and \"$1.8 billion in green cash.\"\n\n\"President Obama gave them 150 billion dollars for nothing, and almost more incredibly, he gave him $1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they're not doing so well, are they? They're not doing so well,\" Trump said.\n\nFacts First: The Iran Deal unlocked Iranian assets that were previously frozen due to sanctions, but it's unclear how much those assets were worth -- $150 billion is the highest estimate provided by US officials, and it's thought that Iran could not have accessed all of that money because much of it was tied up in projects overseas. The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran in two cash payments in 2016.\n\nAt the time, the US Treasury Department estimated that the usable liquid assets Iran would be able to access would equal \"a little more than $50 billion,\" Adam Szubin, then acting Under Secretary of Treasury, said during a 2015 hearing to the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nAnd Trump's assertion that Obama \"gave\" Iran this money is not quite accurate. As part of the deal (which multiple countries were involved in), Iranian assets that existed in banks and financial institutions across the world were unfrozen.\n\nAs to Trump's claim that Obama gave Iran \"$1.8 billion in green cash,\" that's roughly true. As part of a settlement, Obama transferred $1.7 billion in cash to Iran in 2016. The administration also used the money to pressure Iran to release several American prisoners.\n\nThe Obama administration maintained that the payments were made as a reimbursement to Iran for military equipment that the country had purchased from the US in the late 1970s but the US never delivered on. The entire $1.7 billion, given in two separate payments of $400 million and $1.3 billion, was provided in cash. The timing of the first payment corresponded with Iran's release of the American prisoners, which occurred the same day.",

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday Trump said there were \"a lot of insurance reasons\" for why he couldn't go in.\n\nThat isn't true.\n\nFacts First: \"There were no insurance reasons\" why Trump could not have entered St. John's Church, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington told CNN on Friday. She said only a small room in the basement of the church, a nursery, had been damaged in a fire the day prior, and \"the main sanctuary was not harmed at all.\"\n\nTrump has faced criticism not only because police used force to clear peaceful protesters out of the way before the photo-op but because he merely brandished the Bible without opening it, offering a prayer, or going into the building.\n\nAsked by the Wall Street Journal in a Wednesday interview why he didn't pray, Trump said it was \"very, very noisy\" outside because of the protesters. He added: \"And I didn't think it was exactly the right time to pray. I'm on the sidewalk. And the church itself, I didn't want to go in because they had a lot of insurance reasons.

The United States, for example, conducts roughly 21 tests to find one case, whereas Italy, one of the countries hardest and earliest hit by the coronavirus, performs about 188 tests to find a case. Russia has conducted more daily tests on a per-capita basis than the United States, but its share of tests that come back as positive is lower.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump Said\n\n“Look at what happened tonight.

But they were very violent. And our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side.”\n\nThis lacks evidence. Reporters for The New York Times and other news organizations at the rally reported there were few protests and clashes with Trump supporters. A journalist for The Los Angeles Times said on Twitter that an entrance was closed briefly but that no one was turned away.\n\nEven on the Fox News Channel, coverage leading into Mr. Trump’s rally showed few people milling about outside the BOK Center in Tulsa, Okla., and noted that there was little interaction between Trump supporters and people protesting his event.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump Said\n\n“He installed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be in charge of environmental policy … I don’t think that’s going to work out too well, but she’s actually in charge of environmental policy … She’s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn’t have a clue.

          "title": "Fact check: J. Marion Sims did medical experiments on Black female slaves",
          "text": "Fact check: Father of modern gynecology performed experiments on enslaved Black women\n\nThe claim: The “father of modern gynecology” J. Marion Sims performed experiments on Black female slaves without anesthesia\n\nA statue of J. Marion Sims stood across from the New York Academy of Medicine in Central Park from the 1890s until 2018. Sims, known as the “father of modern gynecology,” contributed revolutionary tools and techniques to the medical field, like the modern-day speculum and the Sims position. His breakthroughs emerged from experiments on enslaved Black women without the use of anesthesia.\n\nA Facebook post from 2017 depicts a group of women standing in front of the Sims statue in Central Park, robed in hospital gowns splattered with red paint. The activists from Black Youth Project 100 demanded that the statue of Sims be removed.\n\nOn April 17, 2018, the statue came down after New York City’s Public Design Commission voted unanimously to do so, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered its removal.\n\nOther viral social media posts point to a portrait of Sims and a Black patient. The caption says: \"After perfecting the techniques on black enslaved woman with out anesthesia in America, Sims went on to offer the procedure in Europe to wealthy white women who were sedated. This man is arguably the most famous American surgeon of the 19th century. I see him no different than Josef Megele (sic) both pure monsters.\"\n\nJosef Mengele was a Nazi SS physician who \"conducted inhumane medical experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz,\" according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nAre these allegations true?\n\nSims: His life and controversial research\n\nSims (1813-83) earned his medical degree from Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College and, according to the Encyclopedia of Alabama, practiced medicine in Alabama from 1835 to 49.\n\nHis crowning medical achievements include perfecting the method for repairing vesicovaginal fistula. In addition, he is credited with the “first successful gallbladder surgery and the first successful artificial insemination,” according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut his controversial methods have shrouded his reputation. Vanessa Northington Gamble, a professor at George Washington University, said that between 1846 and 1849, Sims operated on at least 10 enslaved women without anesthesia. One enslaved woman, Anarcha, endured at least 30 painful surgeries. Gamble said that after he practiced his methods on Black women, Sims moved to New York City to open a women’s hospital in the 1850s. He started treating white women, but with anesthesia.\n\nSome in the medical field have defended Sims, his methods and his discoveries. In the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Irwin H. Kaiser called Sims a “product of his era.” For medical historians like Gamble, the consent (or lack thereof) of the enslaved women subjected to these painful experiments must be considered.\n\n“These women were property. These women could not consent,” she said. “These women also had value to the slaveholders for production and reproduction –– how much work they could do in the field, how many enslaved children they could produce.”\n\nIn addition to the Central Park statue, a painting at the University of Alabama at Birmingham came down in 2006 and an endowed chair honoring him at the Medical University of South Carolina was renamed in 2018, according to The Atlantic.\n\nThe portrait mentioned in some posts is by Robert Thom as part of a series of portraits, \"Great Moments in Medicine,\" that was commissioned by pharmaceutical firm Parke Davis, according to the American Historical Association. An article from the AHA noted: \"Vibrant copies of these portraits were sent out by the millions to doctor’s offices across the country between 1948 and 1961.\"\n\nThe paintings are part of the collection at the University of Michigan Museum of Art, a gift from Pfizer, which owns Parke Davis.\n\n'Black women don't feel pain.' Did Sims say this?\n\nGamble wrote for the American Journal of Public Health that Sims only began to use anesthesia in his procedures with white women, after he had already experimented with the bodies of Black women. Some experts, like L.L. Wall at Washington University in St. Louis, defend his practices for his time period. Wall wrote that critics of Sims tend to overlook the “controversies that surrounded the introduction of anaesthesia into surgical practice in the middle of the 19th century.”\n\nHowever, according to Brynn Holland at History.com, “Sims’s decision to not use (anesthesia) — or any other numbing technique — was based on his misguided belief that Black people didn’t experience pain like white people did.” In addition, Holland reported that Sims had warped ideas about developmental differences between African Americans and white people; namely, that African American “skulls grew too quickly around their brain,” making them less intelligent.\n\nWhile the statement “Black women don’t feel pain” included in one Facebook post does not appear to be a verbatim quote from Sims, a number of sources support that he espoused this belief. Diana E. Alexson wrote that “Sims failed utterly to recognise his patients as autonomous persons” in her study, “Women as Victims of Medical Experimentation: J. Marion Sims' Surgery on Slave Women, 1845-1850.”\n\nOur rating: True\n\nThough the direct quote in the Facebook post –– “Black women don’t feel pain” –– does not appear verbatim in reports about J. Marion Sims, this certainly reflects Sims’ established beliefs, which have been studied and supported by numerous researchers. The facts presented in the posts about Sims and the conditions of his research are TRUE.\n\nOur fact-checked sources:\n\nHistory.com, Dec. 4, 2018 - “The ‘Father of Modern Gynecology’ Performed Shocking Experiments on Slaves”\n\nMedical Dictionary, Sims position\n\nHanifahx Holla, Facebook post\n\nNew York Daily News, Aug. 20, 2017 - “Protesters demand removal of Central Park statue of 19th century doctor who experimented on slave women”\n\nVox, April 18, 2018 - “New York just removed a statue of a surgeon who experimented on enslaved women”\n\nEncyclopedia of Alabama, J.

          "title": "The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter: PolitiFact’s methodology for independent fact-checking",
          "text": "Fact-checking journalism is the heart of PolitiFact. Our core principles are independence, transparency, fairness, thorough reporting and clear writing. The reason we publish is to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy.\n\nSince our launch in 2007, we’ve received many questions about how we choose facts to check, how we stay nonpartisan, how we go about fact-checking and other topics. This document attempts to answer those questions and many more.\n\nHow PolitiFact started\n\nOur ownership\n\nOur partner websites\n\nOur funding\n\nOur ethics policy for PolitiFact journalists\n\nHow we choose claims to fact-check\n\nOur on-the-record sourcing\n\nHow we determine Truth-O-Meter ratings\n\nHow we determine Flip-O-Meter ratings\n\nHow we track campaign promises\n\nHow we correct our mistakes\n\nHow to support us\n\nHow to contact us\n\nHow PolitiFact started\n\nPolitiFact started in 2007 as an election-year project of the Tampa Bay Times (then named the St. Petersburg Times), Florida’s largest daily newspaper.\n\nFrom the beginning, PolitiFact focused on looking at specific statements made by politicians and rating them for accuracy. PolitiFact is run by the editors and journalists who make up the PolitiFact team. No one tells us what to write about or how to rate statements. We do so independently, using our news judgment.\n\nOur ownership\n\nPolitiFact is owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute for Media Studies. PolitiFact had been owned by the Tampa Bay Times, but in 2018 direct ownership of PolitiFact was transferred from the Times to Poynter, which is the newspaper’s parent company. The move allows PolitiFact to function fully as not-for-profit national news organization.\n\nThe ties between the Poynter Institute and the Tampa Bay Times go back decades. The longtime owner of the Times was Nelson Poynter, whose father had bought the newspaper in 1912. Poynter championed independent journalism and wanted to ensure that the newspaper remain locally owned and protected from chain ownership. So upon his death in 1978, he left the newspaper not to his heirs, but to the school for journalists that now bears his name.\n\nNelson Poynter was also the founder of Congressional Quarterly, a news organization covering Congress in Washington, D.C., that the Poynter Institute owned until 2009. PolitiFact now continues the Poynter Institute’s historical connection to Washington-based political journalism.\n\nControl of both the Poynter Institute and the Tampa Bay Times lies with a single executive. Upon retirement, that leader picks a successor. Poynter himself picked Eugene Patterson, who picked Andrew Barnes, who picked the Times' current chairman and CEO, Paul Tash, a lifelong journalist.\n\nOur partner websites\n\nPolitiFact has several companion websites. PolitiFact runs PunditFact, a site devoted to fact-checking talking heads, as well as PolitiFact Florida, aimed at state-level fact-checking. Other PolitiFact state sites are run by news organizations that have partnered with PolitiFact. The state sites follow the same principles as the national site.\n\nSome of our current partners are newspapers, such as the Austin American-Statesman (part of GateHouse Media); and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (part of Gannett Co. Inc.). Our partners also include Capital Public Radio based in Sacramento, Calif., and VTdigger.org, an independent Vermont-based news website.\n\nOur funding\n\nIn the years following our start, PolitiFact relied primarily on financial support from the Tampa Bay Times newspaper. Today, we receive support from revenue generated through content partnerships, online advertising and grants. In 2017, PolitiFact launched a membership campaign called the Truth Squad to allow donations from readers and fans of fact-checking.\n\nPolitiFact discloses any individual donation or grant in excess of $1,000. We also disclose organizations that contributed more than 5 percent of total PolitiFact revenues in the previous calendar year. (See the list.) PolitiFact does not accept donations from anonymous sources, political parties, elected officials or candidates seeking public office, or any other source we would consider a conflict of interest.\n\nPolitiFact does not give donors, advertisers or grantmakers any influence over content or ratings. Our contracts and grant agreements have clauses asserting our editorial independence.\n\nDecisions on coverage, what facts to check, and Truth-O-Meter ratings are determined solely by PolitiFact’s independent journalists.\n\nOur ethics policy for PolitiFact journalists\n\nPolitiFact seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases. Our journalists set their own opinions aside as they work to uphold principles of independence and fairness. (See a list of our current journalists and their biographies.)\n\nAs part of that effort, PolitiFact journalists avoid the public expression of political opinion and public involvement in the political process.\n\nWe don’t make political contributions or work on campaigns. We don’t sign online petitions, post yard signs, or participate in political marches.\n\nWe avoid expressing political views on social media. We do share news stories and other journalism, but we take care not to be seen as endorsing or opposing a political figure or position. We avoid snarky commentary.\n\nWe may participate in the political process as voters, because we also have responsibilities as individual citizens of the United States. But we keep our votes to ourselves as a matter of principle. Our goal is to be open-minded in all of our work.\n\nThis policy applies to full-time staffers, correspondents and interns. We avoid doing anything that compromises PolitiFact or our ability to do our jobs with independence and fairness.\n\nHow we choose claims to fact-check\n\nEach day, PolitiFact journalists look for statements to fact-check. We read transcripts, speeches, news stories, press releases, and campaign brochures. We watch TV and scan social media. Readers send us suggestions via email to [email protected]; we often fact-check statements submitted by readers. Because we can't feasibly check all claims, we select the most newsworthy and significant ones.\n\nIn deciding which statements to check, we consider these questions:\n\n• Is the statement rooted in a fact that is verifiable? We don’t check opinions, and we recognize that in the world of speechmaking and political rhetoric, there is license for hyperbole.\n\n• Does the statement seem misleading or sound wrong?\n\n• Is the statement significant? We avoid minor \"gotchas\" on claims that are obviously a slip of the tongue.\n\n• Is the statement likely to be passed on and repeated by others?\n\n• Would a typical person hear or read the statement and wonder: Is that true?\n\nWe select statements about topics that are in the news. Without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from both Democrats and Republicans. At the same time, we more often fact-check the party that holds power or people who repeatedly make attention-getting or misleading statements.\n\nOur on-the-record sourcing\n\nPolitiFact uses on-the-record interviews and publishes a list of sources with every fact-check. When possible, the list includes links to sources that are freely available, although some sources rely on paid subscriptions. The goal is to help readers judge for themselves whether they agree with the ruling.\n\nWe always contact or attempt to contact the person, website or organization that made the statement we are fact-checking.\n\nEvery fact-check is different, but generally speaking our reporting process includes the following: a review of what other fact-checkers have found previously; a thorough Google search; a search of online databases; consultation with a variety of experts; a review of publications and a final overall review of available evidence.\n\nWe emphasize primary sources and original documentation. We seek direct access to government reports, academic studies and other data. It’s not sufficient for us to get something second-hand. We don’t rely on what a campaign or elected official tells us -- we verify it independently.\n\nIn cases where PolitiFact must cite news reports from other media that rely on unnamed or unattributed sources (usually due to the extreme newsworthiness of the report), we note that we cannot independently verify their reporting.\n\nHow we determine Truth-O-Meter ratings\n\nThe goal of the Truth-O-Meter is to reflect the relative accuracy of a statement. The meter has six ratings, in decreasing level of truthfulness:\n\nTRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nHALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nFALSE – The statement is not accurate.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the speaker, and we rate statements based on the information known at the time the statement is made.\n\nThe reporter who researches and writes the fact-check suggests a rating when they turn in the report to an assigning editor. The editor and reporter review the report together, typically making clarifications and adding additional details. They come to agreement on the rating. Then, the assigning editor brings the rated fact-check to two additional editors.\n\nThe three editors and reporter then review the fact-check by discussing the following questions.\n\n• Is the statement literally true?\n\n• Is there another way to read the statement? Is the statement open to interpretation?\n\n• Did the speaker provide evidence? Did the speaker prove the statement to be true?\n\n• How have we handled similar statements in the past? What is PolitiFact’s jurisprudence?\n\nThe three editors then vote on the rating (two votes carry the decision), sometimes leaving it as the reporter suggested and sometimes changing it to a different rating. More edits are made; the report is then published.\n\nHow we determine Flip-O-Meter ratings\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter rates an official's consistency on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment about a politician who changes positions on an issue. Some voters appreciate politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of their voters.\n\nStill, accusations of shifting positions are common in politics, and we’ve found that an analysis of the shift and the degree of change can be informative.\n\nThe Flip-O-Meter has three ratings:\n\nNO FLIP – No significant change in position.\n\nHALF FLIP – A partial change in position.\n\nFULL FLOP – A complete change in position.\n\nThe writing, editing and rating process for Flip-O-Meter reports is similar to the process for Truth-O-Meter fact-checks.\n\nHow we track campaign promises\n\nPolitiFact tracks campaign promises in order to inform readers how well elected officials carry out their agenda. We rate campaign promises based on verifiable outcomes, not on intentions or effort.\n\nTo create our promise meters, such as the Trump-O-Meter, we pore through speech transcripts, TV appearances, position papers and campaign websites looking for promises.\n\nWe define a promise as a prospective statement of an action or outcome that is verifiable. All of our promises list the source.\n\nThe promise meters have six ratings. The first three provide a broad picture of whether the official is making progress; the final three indicate whether he or she kept the promise.\n\nNOT YET RATED — Every promise begins at this level and retains this rating until we see evidence of progress — or evidence that the promise has stalled.\n\nIN THE WORKS — This indicates the promise has been proposed or is being considered.\n\nSTALLED — There is no movement on the promise, perhaps because of limitations on money, opposition from lawmakers or a shift in priorities.\n\nCOMPROMISE — Promises earn this rating when they accomplish substantially less than the official’s original statement but when there is still a significant accomplishment that is consistent with the goal of his original promise.\n\nPROMISE KEPT — Promises earn this rating when the original promise is mostly or completely fulfilled.\n\nPROMISE BROKEN – The promise has not been fulfilled. This could occur because of inaction by the executive or lack of support from the legislative branch or other group that was critical for the promise to be fulfilled. A Promise Broken rating does not necessarily mean that the executive failed to advocate for the policy.\n\nPromise ratings change when circumstances change. For some promises, it's possible that the status could initially go to In the Works, but then move back to Stalled if we decide the proposal has hit a lull, and then go back to the In the Works. Similarly, a promise could be rated Promise Kept, but if the official reversed course, the promise would then be rated Promise Broken.\n\nHow we correct our mistakes\n\nMistakes happen. PolitiFact corrects errors as quickly as possible and with appropriate transparency.\n\nMajor errors of fact – A serious error that results in a new rating or otherwise changes the general outlook of the fact-check receives a mark of correction at the top of the fact-check.\n\nThe text of the fact-check is updated with the new information, and an archived copy of the previous fact-check is preserved and linked to. Additionally, the link text for the item is marked as updated. Corrected fact-checks receive a tag of \"Corrections and updates.\"\n\nErrors of fact – Errors of fact that do not impact the rating or do not change the general outlook of the fact-check receive a mark of correction at the bottom of the fact-check.\n\nThe text of the fact-check is updated with the new information. The correction states the correct information that has been added to the report. If necessary for clarity, it repeats the incorrect information. Corrected fact-checks receive a tag of \"Corrections and updates.\"\n\nTypos, grammatical errors, misspellings – We correct typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, transpositions and other small errors without a mark of correction or tag and as soon as they are brought to our attention.\n\nUpdates – From time to time, we add additional information to stories and fact-checks after they’ve published, not as a correction but as a service to readers. Examples include a response from the speaker we received after publication (that did not change the conclusion of the report), or breaking news after publication that is relevant to the check. Updates can be made parenthetically within the text with a date, or at the end of the report. Updated fact-checks receive a tag of \"Corrections and updates.\"\n\nExplanatory editor’s notes – Sometimes we alert readers to other information that would be helpful, without changing the original report, such as an outpouring of reader response. In those cases, we post an editor’s note, either at the top or the bottom of the report, as appropriate. Editor’s notes are sometimes used on initial publication to explain a special report’s purpose or outlook.\n\nHow to support us\n\nReader contributions are one of our main sources of funding. We ask readers to support our journalism by joining the Truth Squad, a membership group for those who want to see our fact-checking work continue and grow. Truth Squad members help ensure that our content remains free to all readers.\n\nTruth Squad members receive regular communications from the PolitiFact team, as well as perks such as Pants on Fire stickers.\n\nReaders can also support us by signing up for our weekly email, liking us on Facebook, or following us on Twitter.\n\nFinally, readers can support us by sharing our work with friends and family.\n\nHow to contact us\n\nThe best way to contact us for general questions, complaints, praise and ideas for things to fact-check is through our email account, [email protected].\n\nFor questions about our Truth Squad membership program, the email is [email protected].\n\nYou will find contact information for individual journalists, both email addresses and phone numbers, on their staff profiles.

          "title": "Polls show most Democrats, many Americans back key Bernie Sanders' policies",
          "text": "In his speech after the Nevada caucuses, Pete Buttigieg took a shot at his rival Bernie Sanders, who had just won a clear victory.\n\n\"Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil,\" Buttigieg said. \"He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.\"\n\nButtigieg is wrong to say most Democrats don’t support Sanders’ agenda. Polling shows that key elements of Sanders’ economic platform are strongly popular among Democrats. And several of them score majority support among all voters.\n\nHowever, support among all voters for some of Sanders’ proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs. And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options — some of them backed by Sanders’ competitors — receive wider support from voters than his proposals do.\n\nWould Sanders’ platform \"reorder the economy\"?\n\nWe looked at several elements of Sanders’ platform that could potentially have an impact on the economy. They include instituting single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave.\n\nWe found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as \"reordering\" the economy.\n\nBy shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for 17.7% of the nation’s gross domestic product.\n\nThis policy, and breaking up big banks, \"would change things in a major way,\" said Stanford University economist Roger Noll. \"These are huge sectors.\"\n\nThe Green New Deal would affect a smaller, but still substantial, share of the economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels. The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee.\n\nEconomists’ views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector — making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt — could have a significant impact on the economy. And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders’ plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors.\n\n\"It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,\" said Daniel Mitchell, a pro-free market economist.\n\nHow popular are Sanders’ proposals?\n\nWe collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below. The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.\n\nThe data shows that — contrary to what Buttigieg said — a large share of Democrats support Sanders’ economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.\n\nAmong all Americans, only one of these policies — single-payer health care — gets less than 50% support. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters.\n\nWarning signs\n\nThat said, other poll results give Buttigieg’s remark some support.\n\nFirst, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance.\n\nAs it turns out, Buttigieg’s own policy preference — a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it — wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system.\n\nIn February 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both. Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer.\n\nSecond, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option — often including the cost required — usually reduced the levels of support. Here are some examples:\n\n• $15 minimum wage. A SurveyMonkey poll conducted for Business Insider asked two questions about the $15 minimum wage. The first was, \"Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?\" This question elicited 63% support among all respondents.\n\nThe second question added that the Congressional Budget Office — the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress — found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%.\n\n• Student loan forgiveness. A Quinnipiac University poll in April 2019 asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness.\n\nFirst, the pollsters asked, \"Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?\" This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats.\n\nThen they asked, \"Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?\" On this question, Democratic support remained strong — 72% — but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition.\n\n• Paid family leave. A survey sponsored by the libertarian Cato Institute showed strong initial support — 74% among all respondents — for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need. But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned. The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes.\n\n• Green New Deal. A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs. These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%).\n\nThe one unpopular aspect of the plan? Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents.\n\nOur ruling\n\nButtigieg said that Sanders would \"go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.\"\n\nIn reality, polling consistently shows that most Democrats do approve of key parts of Sanders’ economic agenda, including single-payer health care, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, student debt forgiveness, a $15 minimum wage, breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans — but still a majority — signal their support.\n\nIt’s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies’ costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg’s plan — the public option to buy into Medicare — is more popular than Sanders’ single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.",

          "title": "Does Bernie Sanders have “strong support” in rural and red Vermont?",
          "text": "Because Vermont does not require voters to register with a party to vote in elections, there’s no data on how many Republican voters crossed over in these elections to vote for Sanders.\n\nIn the past 30 years, Sanders has dropped below 50% of the popular vote only a handful of times in Vermont's five most rural and conservative counties.\n\nIn general election contests since 1990, Sanders has demonstrated he has been able to receive the majority of the votes in both the most rural and conservative areas of the state.\n\nElectability is at the front of the minds of Democratic voters as they mull who to support in the primary contest.\n\nPeople in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and the now fast-approaching Super Tuesday states have been deciding whether the self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., can win over moderate Democrats and go on to defeat President Donald Trump in a general election.\n\nIn the runup to the Iowa caucuses, where the Vermont senator finished in the top two — bunched with former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Jane O’Meara Sanders, senior adviser and the wife of Bernie Sanders, claimed on Twitter that her husband has a track record of support in the Republican pockets of Vermont.\n\n\"@BernieSanders receives strong support from the conservative & most rural part of Vermont. Even if they don’t agree with him on everything, they appreciate his honesty, hard work & that he’s fighting for workers,\" Jane Sanders tweeted.\n\nSanders is immensely popular in Vermont, consistently ranking among the top U.S. senators for favorability in the country, but does the progressive politician have \"strong\" support in the state’s most conservative and rural area?\n\nSupport for Sanders in Republican Vermont\n\nThe Sanders campaign provided results from the 2018 election as evidence to support Jane Sanders’ statement.\n\nThe campaign highlighted the large number of towns and counties which Sanders carried in the Senate race, but which also voted for incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Scott in the gubernatorial election.\n\nWhile it is true that many counties voted for both Scott and Sanders during the 2018 election, this does not address the portion of Jane Sanders’ claim that the conservative and \"most rural\" area in Vermont supports the senator.\n\nThe most strongly Republican areas in the state are the counties that make up the Northeast Kingdom — Essex, Orleans and Caledonia — along with Franklin and Rutland counties.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nVTDigger analyzed general election data from the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office for these five counties since 1990 — the year Vermont first sent Sanders to Congress — to see how the Vermont senator has fared against Republicans in the most conservative areas of the state.\n\nSince 1990, Sanders has dropped below the 50% threshold in Essex County just four times — 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2018, once in Caledonia County — in 1994, and has never dipped below 50% support in Orleans County.\n\nIn that same time period, 1994 was the only election he did not receive 50% of the vote in Rutland and Franklin counties.\n\nThe 1994 race was a competitive contest between the incumbent Sanders and Republican John Carroll. Sanders received 49.9% while Carroll finished 3 points behind with 46.6%. While Sanders received fewer votes than Carroll in several of the towns in the Northeast Kingdom, it was by small margins demonstrating competitiveness in the region.\n\nInterestingly, during that contest, Sanders did not carry Shelburne or South Burlington but did receive more support than Carroll in Rutland City.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2006, Sanders never dipped below 56% support in Essex County and in his 2012 reelection bid he got more than 60% of the vote in the county. The last election, in 2018, was the first time since 1996 that he received less than 60% of the vote in Caledonia County.\n\nBecause Vermont does not require voters to register with a party to vote in elections, there’s no data on how many Republican voters crossed over in these elections to vote for Sanders.\n\n\"It is true that Bernie has done well in the smaller towns in Vermont for a very long time,\" said Eric Davis, professor emeritus of political science at Middlebury College.\n\n\"Is it conservative voters in those towns or is it more progressive voters in those towns? We don't know,\" Davis added. \"What we do know is, he has done well among the rural areas of the state. We do not know if he has done well among conservative voters.\"\n\nOur Ruling\n\nOn Jan. 26, Jane O’Meara Sanders tweeted that her husband, Bernie Sanders, \"receives strong support from the conservative & most rural part of Vermont\" as an argument why he is electable.\n\nIn general election contests since 1990, Sanders has demonstrated he has been able to receive the majority of the votes in both the most rural and conservative areas of the state — even if Vermont Republicans may not agree with all of his policies.\n\nWe rate this statement True. ​",

          "text": "During his 2020 campaign, Bloomberg called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nBloomberg called for expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, rather than raising the minimum wage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders welcomed Democratic rival Mike Bloomberg into the thick of the presidential primary with a slew of attacks on the former New York City mayor’s moderate record.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of Democrats in Nevada, Sanders contrasted his own consistent support for raising the minimum wage with Bloomberg’s on-the-record opposition.\n\n\"We will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who in 2015 stated, and I quote: ‘I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,’\" Sanders said.\n\nWe wondered if that was true, and it is. It’s worth clarifying that this is no longer Bloomberg’s position in 2020.\n\nBloomberg supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, up from $7.25, putting him in line with the rest of his primary opponents.\n\nRELATED: Who led the way for a $15 minimum wage in New York?\n\nRELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on a $15 minimum wage\n\nBloomberg preferred tax credit to wage hike\n\nIn 2015, Bloomberg spoke against raising the minimum wage:\n\n\"I, for example, am not in favor, have never been in favor of raising the minimum wage,\" Bloomberg said on the Bloomberg TV channel. (Sanders quoted him accurately.)\n\nBloomberg went on to describe what he would support: raising the Earned Income Tax Credit. Doing so, he said, would reduce the burden on employers and protect jobs.\n\n\"I think you should raise the income tax credit, which does the same thing for the same people, but it spreads the burden across all the taxpayers rather than just a small number of businesspeople whose inclination would be to cut back employment. Earned Income Tax Credit doesn’t get anybody to cut back, it gets them to hire more people.\"\n\nThe federal Earned Income Tax Credit reduces taxes for low- and moderate-income working people. About 29 states have passed their own earned-income tax credit. While mayor in 2004, Bloomberg signed legislation starting a local tax credit.\n\nIn 2018, Bloomberg again called for using the tax credit rather than hiking the minimum wage. During an interview with Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, he repeated his concern that a hike in the minimum wage would lead to job losses. (The Congressional Budget Office has found far more people would receive wage hikes than likely lose their jobs under a national increase to $15 an hour.)\n\nBloomberg’s support for the tax credit rather than a rise in the minimum wage is shared by some experts. However, others say the two policies can work in tandem, and both could help poor workers.\n\nWhile Bloomberg spoke broadly against a minimum wage increase, in 2012 he did support raising the minimum wage in New York to $8.25 an hour. Also, Bloomberg had a mixed record on living-wage proposals to lift wages of certain workers who were employed by entities that had city contracts. When Bloomberg opposed such measures, he raised concerns about the cost for the city or the impact on economic development.\n\nBloomberg now supports $15 minimum wage\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign for president, Bloomberg has called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He also calls for enhancing the tax credit.\n\nBloomberg’s labor plan says he will sign the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage gradually over six years to $15 an hour. The bill passed the House in July 2019 and has not had a vote in the Senate.\n\nThe Bloomberg campaign did not explain the change of position. Bloomberg has not publicly addressed it, as far as we can tell.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSanders quoted Bloomberg as saying in 2015 that he had never supported raising the minimum wage.\n\nBloomberg did make that statement. He called for raising the Earned Income Tax Credit instead.\n\nBloomberg changed his position in 2020. He now supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over six years.\n\nWith that clarification, we rate this statement Mostly True.",

          "text": "- The governor's left out context about total spending on OneCare that would have left his audience with a different impression.\n\n- Gov. Phil Scott said paying providers through OneCare saved the state $7.7 million on Medicaid spending in 2018.\n\n- Vermont hopes to have it's signature health care reform effort, led by OneCare Vermont, fully rolled out by 2022.\n\nClarification: This article has been revised from its original posting, after Gov. Phil Scott’s office reached out with additional information clarifying his statement as focusing on the Medicaid patient pool. This made the statement more accurate — we changed the ruling from mostly false to half true — but Scott still left out important context about overall costs associated with the OneCare program.\n\nGov. Phil Scott trumpeted the successes of Vermont’s health care reform efforts in his budget address last month.\n\n\"There are compelling stories to be told, and accountable care is showing more potential than any other health care reform I can remember,\" he said of OneCare Vermont, the state’s accountable care organization.\n\n\"In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million,\" Scott said.\n\nThat savings figure jumped out at us. Our research on OneCare has found mixed results — and\n\nan open admission from health care officials that the program has not yet created the savings they hope to achieve. Did we miss something?\n\nWe asked Scott’s office for evidence and were referred to Ena Backus, director of health care reform for the state. She cited a Department of Vermont Health Access report on 2018 results for Medicaid patients.\n\nThe $7.7 million in savings came from a small portion of Vermont’s nearly 200,000 Medicaid patients. About 42,000 of those Vermonters participate in OneCare, said Alicia Cooper, director of payment reform for the department. An even smaller portion of those patients see doctors who are paid a set fee each month, rather than payments for each procedure.\n\nAnd it’s that subset of patients — those participating in OneCare whose doctors are paid a monthly fee — who cost the state $7.7 million less to care for than was originally expected, according to Backus.\n\n\"That point that was made [by Scott] demonstrates that there was a change in provider behavior that we can measure,\" Backus said.\n\nEthan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, further clarified this point in an email to VTDigger. \"Those words, STATE and THROUGH THE ACO, explicitly describe the population,\" he wrote.\n\nThe problem? Scott referred in his speech to the \"amount of money spent on health care services.\"\n\nFirst off, his statement implies that there were savings in the entire health care system — not just a small piece of it. Secondly, the $7.7 million wasn't returned to taxpayers. Under the new model, OneCare Vermont and hospitals keep the savings, as a reward for keeping patients healthy.\n\nOneCare actually spent more money than expected — about $1.5 million — on all medical care for state Medicaid patients in 2018, if you factor in the doctors who charged traditional fee per procedure rates.\n\nScott also didn’t mention that Vermont taxpayers paid OneCare $11.7 million for administrative costs that year.\n\nOneCare collects money from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance and then distributes it as a flat monthly payment for patient care. The administrative costs and incentives paid by the state cannot be entirely divorced from savings created by the program.\n\nIn addition, the governor cited savings in the Medicaid program but across the OneCare there were no net decreases in spending after administrative costs and incentives for providers.\n\nScott’s assessment led him to urge the Legislature to grant OneCare $5.7 million in additional Medicaid monies during the state budget adjustment process -- on the condition the accountable care organization applies for nonprofit status or meets equivalent transparency standards.\n\nThe real problem, Scott said, is OneCare’s ineffective public relations effort. In his budget speech, the governor invoked the state’s head regulator, Green Mountain Care Board chair Kevin Mullin, who in November urged the organization to tell a better story.\n\n\"I understand the ACO hasn’t done a great job explaining how they’re improving people’s health and reducing costs,\" Scott said. \"But there are compelling stories to be told.\"\n\nCooper, from the Department of Vermont Health Access, said Scott’s $7.7 million assertion may be one of those stories. \"At Medicaid, we‘re encouraged by these early results,\" she said. \"That’s enough to warrant continued testing of the model.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said, \"in 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.\"\n\nThat statement is partially accurate, but it does not account for the administrative costs or financial incentives paid by the state.\n\nPolitifact’s guidance describes \"half true\" as: \"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\n\nScott’s claim ignores important facts about the cost of OneCare that would lead his audience to draw a different conclusion about the program's financial performance — even for the specific patient population that he references in his statement.\n\nWe rate this claim half true. ​",

          "title": "A Vermont Senator says cellphones are the #1 killer of teens. That’s false.",
          "text": "Sen. John Rodgers made national news last week when he introduced a bill that would ban cellphones for Vermonters under the age of 21. It’s not a proposal that Rodgers necessarily supports, but it met his goal of starting a conversation about the lengths we are willing to go to protect children.\n\nTo drive home his point that the gun control bills are as much a waste of time as his cellphone bill, Rodgers made the claim — on many occasions over the past week — that while people are worrying about the dangers of gun violence in Vermont, they are ignoring something far more dangerous: cellphones.\n\n\"Cellphones are far more dangerous than guns are,\" Rodgers said in an interview with VTDigger last week. \"No gun has ever been used to radicalize or recruit terrorists, neo-Nazis or fascists. And the number one killer of teens in the United States is driving while using cellphones.\"\n\nIn emails from his Senate account, Rodgers has doubled down on this point. \"Is it a stunt when I have people around the country talking about the number one killer of teens in America,\" he asked one constituent critical of his cellphone ban proposal.\n\nHe wrote to another angry emailer: \"So you are not concerned with the number one killer of teens in the country. You clueless f - - k!\"\n\nIt’s fair to say Rodgers has been falling back on the claim often as he defends himself from cellphone ban blowback. But is he right?\n\nAn important clarification\n\nWe asked Rodgers where he got his stats. He quickly walked back his original claim.\n\n\"I realize that I have framed that poorly in stating several times that the cell phone use it’s self is the cause when in fact it is a major contributor but not responsible for all accidents,\" Rodgers wrote in an email.\n\nHe’s onto something there.\n\nIt’s true that the leading cause of teen deaths in the U.S. is motor vehicle accidents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that per mile driven, drivers aged 16 to 19 are three times more likely than drivers 20 and older to be in a fatal crash.\n\nIn 2015, motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death among \"children\" 8-15, \"youth\" 15-20, and \"young adults\" 21-24, according to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Suicide was second on the list.\n\nThat means that even including teenagers too young to drive, Rodgers’ idea that motor vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death among teenagers in the United States still holds true. But that’s where the truth in Rodgers’ statement ends.\n\nCellphones are just one factor\n\nFor Rodgers’ claim to be true, an overwhelming majority of teenage motor vehicle deaths would have to have been caused by cellphone use, so much so that it would still outnumber deaths caused by suicide (which account for roughly 1,000 fewer teen deaths than car crashes per year).\n\nHowever, texting comes nowhere close to topping the CDC’s list of the leading causes of teen crashes. Driver inexperience takes first place, followed by driving with teen passengers, nighttime driving, and not using seat belts. Distracted driving (the category that texting while driving falls into) came in fifth.\n\nFurther calling Rodgers’ claim into doubt, cellphone use isn’t even the leading cause of distracted driving.\n\nThe most recent data available shows that in 2017, 271 teenagers died because of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Of those fatalities, only 23% — or 63 teen deaths — were caused by cellphones. There were approximately 2,500 deaths by suicide among people aged 15-19, by comparison.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRodgers claimed that \"the number one killer of teens in the United States is driving while using cellphones.\"\n\nIn 2017, the CDC reported 14,103 total teen deaths (ages 10-19). The same year, the NHTSA reported just 63 deaths caused by cellphone use while driving.\n\nThat means that just about 0.4% of teen deaths are caused by texting while driving. There are many other causes of car crashes, as well as suicide, that have a far higher death toll.\n\nWe rate this claim false.",

          "text": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders isn’t a big fan of President Donald Trump’s latest defense spending bill.\n\nTuesday morning, the U.S. Senate voted 86-8 in favor of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020, sending it to the president for his signature.\n\nThe day before senators passed the legislation, Sanders published an op-ed in the Washington Post panning the proposal, writing he opposes the bill as he as \"all previous Trump military budgets.\"\n\nHours after the Tuesday vote, the Vermont senator and Democratic candidate for president doubled down, posting a video to his campaign’s social media accounts, in which Sanders explained how cutting defense spending could pay for his proposed social programs.\n\nSanders begins his video with a claim about his voting record on Trump’s defense spending proposals.\n\n\"I am very proud that I am the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of Trump's defense budgets,\" Sanders says in the campaign video.\n\nBut Sanders, like many other candidates who also serve in the Senate, missed this week’s vote. So how can he claim to have voted against it? And is he actually the only anti-Trump presidential candidate in the Democratic field who has voted against all of the president’s defense budgets?\n\nStarting with the voting record\n\nSanders’ presidential campaign declined to comment on the statement, referring questions to Sanders’ Senate office. Keane Bhatt, Sanders’ Senate spokesperson, pointed to the Vermont independent’s votes against the defense budget bill for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nBhatt deferred back to the campaign on the first part of Sanders’ claim that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to vote against all of Trump’s military spending bills. The campaign did not respond with evidence to support this part of the statement.\n\nSanders has voted against the last three national defense authorization bills but he was not present in the Senate for Tuesday’s vote on the bill he has publicly opposed.\n\nSanders’ Senate office also said his vote against the defense spending bill fiscal year 2017 was evidence he has voted against all of Trump’s military budget bills. However, the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017 was signed by former President Barack Obama on Dec. 23, 2016, and not by Trump.\n\nA survey of Sanders’ record on Trump’s defense spending bills has him voting against the first two but missing the vote earlier this week. The Vermont independent also missed the chance to vote on this year’s military spending bill in June when the Senate moved it to the House of Representatives.\n\nDemocratic candidates against military budgets\n\nSanders also claims he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against all of the president’s defense budgets.\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., all missed this week’s vote on the military spending bill. Warren voted against last year’s defense budget, but supported Trump’s first national defense authorization proposal. Booker and Klobuchar have supported both of Trump’s previous military budget bills.\n\nHowever, there is one other candidate in the crowded Democratic field who has cast votes in opposition of all three of the president’s defense authorization bills.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii — who is polling between 1% and 3% nationally and has remained in the race as others have started dropping out — was one of 48 House members to vote against the current $738 billion spending proposal. Gabbard has also cast no votes on the legislation in 2018 and 2017 — Trump’s two other military budgets.\n\nThe House member from Hawaii also voted against President Obama’s last defense spending budget in 2016.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nIn a campaign video that has been viewed almost 320,000 times on Twitter alone, Sanders made the statement that he has voted against all of Trump’s defense budgets and that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to do so.\n\nIt is true the Vermont senator has publicly opposed all of the president’s military spending packages, but he has not voted against all of them. Sanders is also wrong to say he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against the proposals. In fact, Gabbard is the only candidate who can make that claim.\n\nWe rate this statement as False.",

          "text": "President Donald Trump’s campaign announced in an email to Vermont media this week that it will be deploying resources to Vermont to help elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2020.\n\nIn the email, the campaign took credit for the economic improvement the state has seen under Trump’s presidency.\n\nIt said that since he took office in 2017, Trump has added thousands of jobs across the state and given Vermonters an average tax cut of about $1,500.\n\nIt also claimed that under Trump, fewer Vermonters have had to rely on food stamps.\n\n\"President Trump has lifted the prospect of voters across Vermont, overseeing a 11,742 decline of Vermont residents on food stamps,\" the campaign wrote.\n\nWe know that Trump is in favor of restricting food stamp eligibility, and has even proposed a rule change that would cut benefits worth $7.5 million to about 5,200 households in Vermont.\n\nBut has his presidency really led to reduced demand for the benefits?\n\nTrump’s campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment, is correct that since the president took office, Vermont has seen about 12,000 fewer people using food stamps.\n\nWhen he entered the White House in January 2017, Vermont had 78,878 residents receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn August 2019, the last month for which public data was available, that number was 67,195 — representing a drop of 11,683.\n\nBut data also show that the demand for food stamps in Vermont has been falling consistently since around 2013, when Vermont’s economy started turning a corner after the Great Recession.\n\nAt peak demand in 2013, about 100,000 Vermonters were using food stamps. By January 2017, when Trump took office, that number had already fallen to about 79,000.\n\nSean Brown, deputy commissioner of Vermont’s Economic Services Division, said that since 2013, when the economy took a turn for the better and jobs started returning to the state, food stamps in Vermont have seen steady decline in use.\n\n\"That’s just been a trend that we’ve been experiencing for the last six years as the economy has improved and stayed strong,\" Brown said.\n\nSince 2014, the steady decline in demand for SNAP benefits has been a national trend, according to Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center.\n\nShe said that Trump deserves some credit for the drop in Vermont and around the U.S., because the economy during his time in office has remained strong. But she said it can’t all be pinned on his presidency.\n\n\"It’s been a continuation of a trend that’s already begun,\" Wexler said. \"Certainly the continued improvement of the economy contributes to that because more people are working and more people may have income available that would put them above that cutoff but it wouldn’t solely be related to one administration or the other.\"\n\nErin O’Brien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston who specializes in U.S. social welfare policy, said that it may not just be the economy that’s leading fewer Vermonters to use food stamps.\n\nTrump’s proposed cuts to SNAP may also be discouraging more people from using the program, she said. And she added that undocumented immigrants may be avoiding signing up for food stamps, fearing Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.\n\n\"It’s not necessarily that people are being lifted out of poverty,\" she said. \"It’s that they’re increasingly afraid to use a government program, or they think it might be cut.\"\n\nShe said that \"correlation isn’t causation,\" and that just because the demand for food stamps has fallen under Trump doesn’t mean he’s responsible for the trend.\n\n\"Sitting presidents like to take credit for trends that predate them when they’re positive, but when it’s bad news sitting presidents are very good at blaming the last guy in office,\" she said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump’s campaign is right about the numbers. About 12,000 fewer Vermonters are on food stamps now than when he first took office.\n\nBut while he may have overseen a decline of Vermonters using the program, the trend has been occurring for years, since the state rebounded from the Great Recession.\n\nIt’s true that the economy has remained strong under Trump’s presidency. But the steady drop in demand for food stamps had started long before he took office, and may not be entirely attributable to economic uplift.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Elaine Waxman’s name.",

          "title": "Governor says Vermont caused Energizer’s pending exit. But he’s got no evidence.",
          "text": "Last week, the Missouri-based battery company Energizer announced plans to close its factory in Bennington.\n\nThe company said it was shuttering the Vermont plant, which manufactures hearing aid batteries, and moving the operation to a new facility in Portage, Wisconsin, following a $2 billion deal to purchase Rayovac.\n\nThe Energizer closing in Bennington will eliminate about 100 jobs. The layoffs are expected to deepen financial strain in the Southwest region of the state, which has seen a sharp decline in employment opportunities since the Great Recession.\n\nGov. Phil Scott called Energizer’s plans \"disappointing\" in a statement released last week. And he blamed the company’s move on larger problems with the state’s business climate.\n\n\"This decision is an unfortunate example of why those of us in Montpelier need to work together to make Vermont a more affordable place to do business and make sure our policies help businesses thrive rather than creating unique burdens and barriers to growth that make us less competitive with other states,\" Scott wrote in a statement last week.\n\nThe governor’s statement draws a direct connection between the state’s business climate and Energizer’s plans to shutter the factory.\n\nWe wondered: Are Vermont’s policymakers to blame for Energizer’s pending departure?\n\nEnergizer has said it is closing the Bennington factory — which was downsized in 2015— to consolidate operations in the Wisconsin Rayovac factory, which also produces hearing aid batteries.\n\nThe only public statements Energizer has made on the decision indicate it is making the move because it would be more efficient for the company to produce the hearing aid batteries in one factory. The Portage plant employs more than twice as many workers than the Bennington facility (about 225 compared to 90). It’s also slightly larger.\n\n\"In order to be successful as a larger company, we are making significant investments to better utilize our existing manufacturing facilities, reduce complexity in our operations, and enhance service to our customers,\" Marcus Boolish, Energizer’s director of government affairs wrote in a letter to Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, last week.\n\nNikki Eaves, an Energizer spokesperson, offered a similar explanation to the Bennington Banner, saying that the facility in Wisconsin is equipped to handle the company’s hearing aid production.\n\n\"As part of the integration,\" she said, \"we reviewed our combined manufacturing footprint and determined the total demand for specialty batteries can be produced more efficiently in one facility.\"\n\nThe company did not respond to questions from VTDigger about whether the state’s business climate contributed to its decision to leave the state.\n\nBut Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for Scott, said that it was \"self-evident\" that Energizer is moving out of state because Vermont’s business environment isn’t competitive.\n\nShe said that if it was \"advantageous\" for Energizer to ramp up its production in Vermont, the company would have kept operations here.\n\nKelley pointed to the fact that Vermont has among the highest power costs in the nation and some of the highest corporate and property taxes, according to the Tax Foundation’s latest business tax climate index. In 2018, Forbes ranked Vermont 47th in its U.S. \"Best for Business\" rankings and said that the cost of doing business in the state is 12% higher than the national average.\n\n\"Businesses are going to do what’s in the best interest of the business,\" Kelley said. \"If their decision is to leave the state for another state, that indicates it is more advantageous and more competitive in that other state.\"\n\nKelly did not, however, provide any additional evidence that Vermont’s business climate contributed to Energizer’s factory consolidation.\n\nSears, the senator from Bennington, said it would be hard to evaluate whether the governor’s statement is true, unless the company provided more information about its decision.\n\n\"I think it’s unclear what the reasons are for them not investing in Vermont,\" he said. \"You can generalize and say it’s anti-business and Wisconsin’s more business-friendly. I don’t know if that’s true or not.\"\n\nThe senator said he couldn’t recall the company lobbying legislators on business issues in the Statehouse, except on one occasion. About a decade ago, when Vermont banned mercury in batteries, the company asked lawmakers for a period of time to phase-out use of the chemical instead of an immediate ban. Sears said he worked to get that language written into the bill.\n\nKelley said the governor’s office was seeking more information from Energizer about its reasons for leaving Vermont.\n\nSen. Brian Campion, D-Bennington, said Scott should have that conversation with Energizer before he \"speculates\" on its motivations.\n\n\"I think it’s important to hear directly from Energizer on what kind of things would have or even could keep them here,\" Campion said, noting that the company doesn’t plan to fully shutter its doors in Bennington until 2021.\n\n\"Are there things that could be done between now and then that could keep Energizer here?\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe governor is correct that by most measures, when compared to other states, Vermont ranks low on business friendliness. But his claim is specifically about Energizer’s reason for leaving.\n\nAccording to Scott’s statement, the fact that Energizer is moving away, in and of itself, reveals the company wasn’t satisfied with Vermont’s business environment.\n\nHis office can provide no evidence to support his claim. The only reason Energizer has cited for its move is that consolidation of operations in its Wisconsin facility — recently purchased from Rayovac — will streamline production.\n\nWe rate this claim false.",

          "text": "Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan began enforcing a new public records rule this month that sparked criticism from transparency advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe rule prevents members of the public from photographing records they are examining unless they pay a fee to reimburse staff for the cost of preparing the documents.\n\nGov. Phil Scott and Secretary of State Jim Condos have said that there is no legal basis for the government to charge members of the public to take photos of records. The attorney general says he interprets the law differently.\n\nDefending his new policy, Donovan has argued that taxpayers should be reimbursed for the time it takes his staff to locate, scrutinize and redact records before inspection—particularly when the majority of requests don't come from members of the public, or the press, but private entities.\n\n\"Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General’s Office are from private law firms and companies,\" Donovan wrote in an op-ed published by VTDigger last week.\n\n\"There is a cost to Vermonters associated with diverting attorney time and resources from my office’s mission,\" he added. \"More to the point, should we provide free legal work to law firms and companies that may take an adverse position to the policies of our state?\"\n\nVTDigger has already asked Donovan’s office to reverse its policy on photographing records. But his justification for it raised even more questions. Do \"most\" requests to his office really come from companies and law firms?\n\nOn Thursday, a day before Donovan's op-ed was published, his office reported that 49% of the public records requests the attorney general's office received this year have come from companies. As of Monday, the office said that number had dropped slightly, to about 45%.\n\nOut of the 126 requests submitted to the attorney general this year, 32 came from members of the press, and 37 came from citizens acting independently, according to a review of the requests submitted to the office which are publicly available online.\n\nThe remaining 57 requests—45.2%— came from companies, law firms and non-profits, which the attorney general's office lumps into one category, \"firms,\" when it tracks incoming records requests, according to Charity Clark, Donovan's chief of staff.\n\nWithin this category, it’s true that law offices and private companies filed most of the requests. But nine of the requests in this category came from non-profits, interest groups and, in one case, a law school.\n\nFour of the requests came from Energy Policy Advocates, a conservative-leaning non-profit dedicated to bringing \"transparency to the realm of energy and environmental policy.\"\n\nAlso among the requesters categorized as \"firms\" were the National Consumer Law Center, a non-profit that focuses on legal and policy work for low income citizens; the Public Rights Project, an organization that advances civil rights and economic justice policies; and Judicial Watch, another right-leaning non-profit focused on government transparency.\n\nA request from Vermont Legal Aid and another from a student at the University of Chicago School of Law were also included in the \"firms\" category.\n\nClark said that the attorney general's office has been tracking public records requests like this for years, starting before Donovan took office.\n\n\"Something that's not a citizen and not a member of the press is going to be in this other group,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Donovan referred to this entire class of requesters as \"private law firms and companies,\" a description that should not encompass universities, non-profit public interest groups and legal support clinics.\n\nIf the \"firms\" category excluded non-profits, there would be nine fewer requests: meaning the total number of from private law firms and companies would only be to 38% of all requests.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nDonovan is correct to say that private law firms and companies frequently ask his office for records—dozens have placed requests this year.\n\nTechnically, their requests don't make up the majority of those the state has received in 2019, although requests from \"firms\" (as defined by the AG’s office) came only one percentage point short of 50% when Donovan made his statement last week.\n\nBut because of the attorney general's methodology for tracking records, non-profit interest groups, a well-respected university, and a legal aid clinic are also included in his tally of \"private law firms and companies\" seeking documents.\n\nThe way Donovan’s office classifies record requesters and his public statements regarding those entities don’t square up.\n\nWe rate this claim mostly false.",
