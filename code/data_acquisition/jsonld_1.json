        "articleBody": "<p>Zoom, the video conferencing app, has had a huge surge in the number of users since the beginning of the lockdown because of the pandemic. Zoom, which only had its eyes on the North American market, has now decided to expand its international market capabilities to cater to the rise of video conferencing and webinars. This exponential growth can be seen in the company's Q1 revenues for the quarter ended April 30, 2020, and saw growth by 169% at $328.2 million. As of April, Zoom had 300 million active users, a big jump from the 10 million users in January. </p><p>But the app has also had its fair share of controversy. In April, it was found that due to a sudden surge in the number of users because of the pandemic, Zoom amped up its server capacity. It let some calls from North America visit Chinese servers as a backup to overcome congestion. </p><p>This was done without the user's knowledge that their data was being routed through China. The root of the problem lies in the lack of end-to-end encryption in these calls, and lead to allegations that sensitive data was being leaked to the government in China. In India, (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) had also issued a notification in April warning users that ZOOM was prone to hacking. The company claims that the issue has been since resolved, and Zoom is now working with CERT-in to remove the advisory issued against the video conferencing app, said Sameer Raje, Head of Zoom Video Communication in India in an interview to BOOM. </p><p>Raje also discussed Zoom's security features, the controversy over their data being routed to servers in China, and the fact that India is now the second biggest market for the video conferencing app, after the US. Raje also highlighted the fact that though Zoom doesn't store any data about a video conferencing meeting, it does provide law enforcement agencies with requests of IP addresses of users where abuse or misdemeanour has been reported. <i>For the full video, log onto YouTube or click on the link <a href='https://youtu.be/vyYQWwmqkeg' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here.  </a><br></i></p><p><i>The full transcript of the interview can be read below.</i></p><p> </p><p><b>Govind Ethiraj: </b>Can you tell us what kind of penetration Zoom has in India? What is the kind of usage that you're seeing between types, or categories of people or even institution?</p><p><b>Sameer Raje: </b>Well, if I have to talk about the number of users on Zoom platform, it's in millions and I'm speaking about only India based users. The situation was slightly different in the pre-COVID time. We could easily categorize customers or users or people or consumers into two different categories. First were the ones who could adopt technology fast. They were the ones who were on a collaboration platform. They were open to certain embracing any types of technologies etc. And there were other sets of users who are kind of bit traditional had a bit of a roadblock about using collaboration technologies. </p><p>They would think, 'Will my employees be productive while working from home and so on so forth?</p><p>I mean these are questions that pop in general right? </p><p>However, during COVID-19 situation what happened is we have seen acceleration on both the fronts. </p><p>The first slot of our consumers are those who have embraced collaboration tools earlier as well, they have adapted even more. </p><p>So earlier probably it was restricted to a certain amount of usage, now, they're using it even more. It has a deeper and wider usage across customer meetings and internal meetings.</p><p>Whereas the second set of users who initially had some innovations, their entire mindset has transformed. There is a complete digital transformation which has got accelerated. So these folks suddenly have started realizing that there is no option but to adopt these technologies and having adopted this technology now they're seeing the benefit of it, be it productivity-wise or as a reduction in costs of travel or even in infrastructure costs. </p><p>So there's an increment in both the sides which we have seen. </p><p><b>Govindraj Ethiraj: </b>Any numbers you can share at all on how Zoom has grown or penetrated?</p><p>Because I'm sure a lot of people are revenue paying customers in India, people are using your webinar feature, and so on. </p><p><b>Sameer Raje:</b> Well, absolutely. I mean, it's not that India has been growing only in the 'freemium' users as we call the fee users. So anybody wanting to do meetings more than 40 minutes, you know, and for more than two participants need to subscribe to the premium account, and there has been tremendous growth. </p><p>We have seen around 4 to 5% increase in paying customers. Freemium users have grown significantly higher--we have friends families, everybody, using it so right. So obviously that growth is much higher that's more than 60-70 %. Those numbers are very high.</p><p><b>Govindraj Ethiraj: </b>What about India as a percentage of global revenue?</p><p><b>Sameer Raje:</b>At this point roughly, all I can say is that we've become the second-largest market probably after the US.</p><p> </p>And that helps me build a case within my HQ, my job has become much more easier simpler. Earlier, to a great...",

        "articleBody": "<p>White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who live-streamed the massacre of 51 people in a mosque in Christchurch, News Zealand in March 2019, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole by a New Zealand court on Thursday.</p><p>The 29-year-old Australian national admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of terrorism - marking the first terrorism conviction in the history of New Zealand. This is also the harshest punishment given out in the country since the death penalty was abolished in 1961.</p><p>On March 15, 2019, Tarrant went on a rampage with a semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, shooting unarmed and unsuspecting Muslim worshipers after Friday prayers at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, killing men, women and children in the process. He reportedly took the life of a 3-year-old Mucad Ibrahim during the rampage, who was his youngest victim. </p><p>The massacre made headlines all over the world when the offender live-streamed the whole act on Facebook live using a body-cam. The video received widespread attention and shares on the social media platform before it was taken town by Facebook.</p><b>Also Read:</b> Controversial YouTuber Hindustani Bhau Propped By Company With Ties To BJP<p>According to news reports, Judge Cameron Mander, who handed down the sentence, called the offender 'inhuman' and 'showing no mercy'. The BBC quoted Judge Mander as saying, 'Your crimes are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die, it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment.'</p><p>Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes told the court that Tarrant regretted not having taken more lives, and even wanted to burn the mosque down to instill fear among Muslims.</p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern reportedly expressed relief at the sentencing. Radio New Zealand quoted her as saying, 'This has been a crime in New Zealand the likes of which has never occurred before and now we've seen a sentence the likes of which we've never seen before as well.'<p>'The other job that we have is making sure that he has no notoriety, that he has no platform, and that we have no cause to think about him, to see him, or to hear from him again,' she added.</p><p>Between August 24 - August 26, Tarrant came face-to-face with survivors and families of his victims, who expressed themselves through the court proceedings, leading to highly tense and emotional moments. He chose not to speak in his defence.</p><p>The court proceedings were streamed on the internet, where Tarrant appeared emotionless to the statements of his victims.</p><p>'O benim Ertu\u011frul'umdu'\u00d6yle bir c\u00fcmle ki, i\u00e7inde as\u0131rlar s\u00fcren \u015fanl\u0131 tarih, y\u00fcz y\u0131ll\u0131k hasret i\u00e7eriyor. #BrentonTarrant#YeniZelanda pic.twitter.com/oASMLIFr0M</p>\u2014 Av.

        "articleBody": "<p>As the total number of cases for COVID-19 reach 25 million, there is a constant chatter about achieving herd immunity against the virus. Herd immunity is when a large proportion of the population has developed immunity against a contagious, infectious disease. This can be achieved either through vaccination or natural infection. </p><p>While scientists across the world, including the likes of Johns Hopkins University believe that around 70% of the population needs to be infected to develop herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization believes that 50% of the population achieving immunity will suffice to control the spread and tackle COVID-19. </p><p>However two of the WHO experts, Director General Tedros Ghebreyeseus as well as Director of Health Emergency Services, Mike Ryan feel that globally we are very far from achieving herd immunity. The Director General has also stated that herd immunity is not a salvation. In order to achieve herd immunity globally, the WHO has created the ACT Accelerator to ensure the equitable distribution of vaccines and medicines. </p>What Is Herd Immunity? <p>Herd Immunity is when a large proportion of the population is protected from being infected by a contagious disease either by being vaccinated against the pathogen or contracting the infection and developing antibodies for the virus. </p><p>For SARS-CoV-2, several vaccines are at various stages of development. Experts believe that till  a proper vaccine is available, people should follow physical distancing norms and proper hygienic practices. </p>Also Read:Explained: Are Human Challenge Trials For COVID-19 Ethical?<p>In herd immunity, after a person has been vaccinated or naturally infected, they either develop antibodies to fight the pathogen or T cells that identify the pathogen to raise an immune response by the body when it encounters the pathogen again. As the number of immune people in the population increases, the rate at which the virus can reproduce decreases. This decreasing reproductive number of the virus contributes in controlling the spread of the disease. </p><p>COVID-19, however, poses a different challenge. As the duration for which immunity can last for the virus is still being studied, cases of reinfection and waning antibodies have been reported across the world. Vaccination for COVID-19, just like in the case of flu, may require booster shots which may not be everlasting. The severity of a reinfection could be milder than the first infection as seen with the flu. </p><p>Natural infection on the other hand could overwhelm the existing health infrastructure globally. Reports of hospitals not being able to manage an increased caseload at the peak of the infection were witnessed in Mumbai, New York and even Italy. </p><p>Currently, various sero-survey studies have been conducted globally to understand the prevalence of the spread of the virus. Most of them only analyse for presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 explaining whether a person has been infected. They do not take into account a subset of neutralizing antibodies that particularly act on the virus. These numbers gauge the spread but are not enough to ascertain herd immunity, experts in the WHO believe. </p><p>While Spain has sero-prevalence in the range of 4.6-5%, CDC in the US has reported a sero-prevalence ranging between 2-10% in 10 regions. India's sero-survey conducted by the ICMR found a 30% spread while specific studies in Delhi and Mumbai have shown a prevalence of 28.35% and 33%. </p><p>The higher prevalence does not reflect herd immunity as the number of daily cases in India are still high. Spain has witnessed a second outbreak, while the US is also reporting 35-60,000 new cases daily. </p>Which Diseases Have We Achieved Herd Immunity For? <p>Measles which requires a 95% herd immunity is one of the contagious diseases eliminated in areas that followed vaccination for measles. Similarly, small pox, diphtheria are other diseases that were reduced and eliminated following herd immunity techniques. </p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>A 33-year-old in Hong Kong was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a second time,142 days after first testing positive, revealed a study done by researchers at the Hong Kong university. This case is the first documented case of reinfection in the world, . Interestingly, scientists at Hong Kong university found that the genomic sequence of the virus in both the COVID-19 infections is different. </p><p> The man who returned from Spain did not exhibit any symptoms this time around. Earlier, he had developed cough and fever as well as a sore throat. This news of a reinfection comes at a time when sero-surveys across the world are trying to identify the longevity of the neutralizing antibodies (fight a pathogen) and the T cells ( cells that identify a recurring pathogen). </p><p>This is not an instance of viral shedding or the remnants of the virus remaining in an infected person's body, said the authors of the study. As the genomic sequence of the virus differs, the person has been reinfected but is asymptomatic. The scientists are trying to find the implications of this finding as it supports the theory that the existing antibodies did stop the virus from having a stronger effect the second time around. </p><p>The variations have been found in the spike proteins with 24 nucleotides which includes the D614G variant that is now prevalent around the world. scientists across the world are studying the duration for which antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are present in an infected person's body. </p><p>Also Read:New COVID-19 Strain Detected In Malaysia? Not Quite</p><p>The study has been  accepted in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases and is yet to be published. </p>Herd Immunity Not Enough<p>On conducting an antibody test, the researchers found that the amount of antibodies against the virus were very low. This has led the researchers to surmise that achieving only herd immunity will not stop the virus from spreading and people from being infected. Vaccinating people that have already been exposed to as well as been diagnosed with COVID-19 should also be given the vaccine as and when it is approved, say the researchers from Hong Kong University. </p><p>Antibody levels from the first and second time were not compared. During the first episode, the antibodies were assessed on the 10th day. Studies suggest that it takes at least 2-3 weeks for antibodies to be developed and the scientists did not have this sample. They even assumed that the reason for the low antibodies in the second infection was that the antibodies fought against the virus. This was why the infection was milder the second time around. </p><p>The scientists believe that SARS-CoV-2 will now act in the same manner as seasonal common cold causing human coronaviruses. Every new infection will be milder, the scientists believe. Further research should be conducted as this is the only documented study so far, the scientists from Hong Kong University said. </p>What Does The WHO Say? <p>In its press conference held on Monday, August 23, Maria Van Kerkhove, epidemiological expert at the World Health Organization said that the reinfection should be studied at a population level.</p><p>'What we are learning about infection is that people do develop an immune response, and what is not completely clear yet is how strong that immune response is and for how long that immune response lasts,' Van Kerkhove said. </p><p>Also Read:No, WHO Is Not Advertising Home-based Jobs To Fight COVID-19</p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>A black man was shot in the back by police officers in the city of Kenosha in Wisconsin, USA on August 24 sparking protests in the city. 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot multiple times by police officers as he tried to get inside of an SUV from the driver's side.   </p><p>  </p><p>Cell phone footage of the incident shows Blake emerging from the passenger side of the car and going around to the driver's side as two police officers follow him. Blake opens the door only for a police officer to pull him by his shirt with one hand. Seven gunshots can be heard as onlookers scream.   </p><p>  </p><p>According to his attorney Ben Crump, Blake was trying to deescalate a domestic situation when police officers tasered him. Blake's three children were in the car when police officers shot their father. Crump also represents George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor whose deaths have brought police brutality and racism back into the spotlight in the US.</p><p>On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a black man died after a police officer knelt on Floyd's neck for almost eight minutes. Floyd's death triggered protests across the US and the world. Floyd's death and subsequent protests led to calls for US police departments to be defunded.</p><p>Floyd's death also brought into the spotlight Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery's deaths. Taylor, 26, was killed when Louisville police officers entered her apartment on March 13 and exchanged fire with Taylor's boyfriend. Taylor was shot eight times in the process. </p><p>Arbery was shot dead by a former police officer and his son on February 23. Arbery, 25, was jogging in a Brunswick neighbourhood in Georgia when Gregory McMichael and his son Travis chased Arbaury and fatally shot him after a short struggle with Travis.</p><p>The video below is graphic in nature. Viewer discretion is advised.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>   <p>  </p><p>  </p><p>The Kenosha police department said in a release that Blake was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee where his condition was said to be serious. In a later statement, the police said that officers were responding to a domestic situation which later led to Blake's shooting.  </p>      <p>  </p><p>Jacob's grandfather, also named Jacob Blake, was a local civil rights leader in Evanston, Illinois and fought for providing low-income houses in the community according to the Chicago Tribune. Following his death, an affordable housing unit for senior citizens was named the Jacob Blake Manor.  </p><p>  </p><p>Jacob's uncle Justin Blake told the Chicago Tribune that his nephew had moved from Evanston to Kenosha as he felt it was a safer location and he could try to build a better life there.   </p><p>  </p><p>Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul refused to say whether any guns were found in Blake's possession or how many police officers were involved in his shooting.  </p><p>  </p><p>The Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating Blake's shooting. While the police officers who were involved in the shooting have not been named, Kenosha police have said that two officers have been placed on administrative leave.  </p><p>  </p><p>Following the shooting, protests broke out in the city with protestors marching on to the Kenosha County Public Safety Building, according to AP. Protestors faced off against police dressed in in riot gear including riot shields. A police officer was hit on the head with a brick by protestors and is currently recovering.  </p><p>  </p><p>CNN reports that several buildings and vehicles were set on fire by protestors who defied the 8 pm curfew imposed by the city. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has deployed the Wisconsin National Guard to Kenosha to help police in containing the protests. The city was placed in curfew till 7 am on Tuesday.   </p><p>  </p><p>Jacob's uncle Justin urged protestors to not turn violent and told CNN, 'After talking to his mother, she and my brother are asking people in Kenosha and around the nation to protest, but protest not violently. We want justice, and we're going to get justice. We're going to demand justice. But we're going to do that without tearing apart our community.'  </p><p>  </p><p>Following the protest, the Kenosha County Courthouse and Administration building has been closed on Monday and Tuesday after allegedly sustaining damage.  </p><p>  </p><p>Police officers in Kenosha are not equipped with body cameras, a staple in many police departments across the US. Kenosha mayor John Ataramian said that the police department is scheduled to receive body cameras by 2022. While police squad cars do have video cameras, it is not clear if they captured officers shooting Blake.  </p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>The Supreme Court on August 25, reserved its verdict on sentencing advocate Prashant Bhushan who was held guilty of contempt for his July tweets that were 'false, malicious and scandalous'. The top court's decision came after hearing day-long arguments from Attorney General KK Venugopal and Bhushan's counsel senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan.</p><p> </p><p>On August 24, Bhushan had filed a supplementary affidavit indicating that he stood by what he said in his first statement and refused to apologise submitting it 'would be insincere'. 'If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution that I hold in the highest esteem,' the supplementary statement read.</p><p>On August 20, the bench led by Justice Arun Mishra advised Bhushan to take 'two to three days' to reconsider the statement he made during the hearing on sentencing. At the time, Bhushan had said that the statement he had made 'was well-considered and thought out'.</p><p> </p><p>'It is unlikely there shall be a change. I don't want to waste your time,' Bhushan had then said.</p><p> </p><p><b>Court must show statesmanship</b></p><p>During the hearing, the bench asked Venugopal to 'guide' the court on this issue. The AG reiterated the opinion he made in the last hearing and asked the court to forgive Bhushan.</p><p> </p><p>'From time to time, retired judges and sitting judges have been making comments. These statements could only be We have serious statements by five judges about Supreme Court having failed to maintain democracy.'</p><p> </p><p>'These statements are telling the court to reform the court\u2026that you should look at the unclear and reform yourself. They seek the improvement of the administration of justice,' the top law officer added. Venugopal said Bhushan could be let go with 'A warning to 'please' not repeat this in future.'</p><p> </p><p>'He need not be punished,' Venugopal said.</p><p> </p><p>'It will be tremendously appreciated if the court leaves it at that. Even if he says he hasn't done anything wrong, this court should take a compassionate view and leave it at that,' Venugopal said adding that he was also speaking for the bar.</p><p> </p><p>Punishing Bhushan under the contempt of courts act would not resolve the issue, Venugopal said. I don't think you should go to the extent, Venugopal observed.</p><p> </p><p>'Let this court show statesmanship and not use the powers of the contempt because of this affidavit,' Venugopal said.</p><p> </p><p><b>What is wrong in apologizing?</b></p><p>The apex court, however, was not inclined toward Venugopal's opinion. The court observed that reprimands would not work. How can we let Bhushan with a simple reprimand when he (Bhushan) admits he hasn't made a mistake?' the bench said.</p><p> </p><p>'Everyone makes a mistake but the person must also realize it. What to do now?' Justice Mishra said responding to Venugopal's suggestion. 'If he believes he has done no wrong, what's the purpose of this warning?' the bench, which also comprised Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, added.</p><p> </p><p>Referring to the Bhushan's reply in the matter where Bhushan had criticized the court for being 'executive-minded', the court said, 'What do you say to this? How do we not consider all this? Prioritization of cases has also been adversely commented upon. Ayodhya case has been commented upon. Which judge is left out (in Bhushan's criticism), sitting or retired?'</p><p> </p><p><b>Do not make Bhushan a martyr</b></p><p>When the hearing resumed after lunch, Dhavan who is representing Bhushan, submitted that the supplementary affidavit could be construed as 'regret', but not an apology. An apology must not be made just to get out of court, Dhavan said. If you invite me for contempt, don't I have a right to defend myself? He added.</p><p> </p><p>Referring to the matter where Justice Mishra\u2014when he at the Calcutta High Court\u2014had pardoned West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her comment against the judiciary, Dhavan said, 'This institution must have criticism, & not just criticism but extreme criticism. Your shoulders are broad enough.'</p><p>'Courts will only survive on strong criticism,' he added. Referring to former top court judges Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph along with former Delhi high court judge AP Shah who had also commented on Chief Justice of India SA Bobde's tryst with the Harley Davidson\u2014this was the subject of Bhushan's contemptuous tweet\u2014Dhavan said, it then follows that they must also be held in contempt.</p><p> </p><p>Rejecting, Venugopal's suggestion of a reprimand, Dhavan asked, 'Should your Lordship reprimand, what is it that he won't do again? Never criticize the court? Put forth his opinion?'</p><p> </p><p>A judgment asking Bhushan to exercise caution and to be a 'little restrained' in future when he criticizes the courts should be statesmanlike and would go a long way in sending a right message. If you bar him from practising in court, you must hear him first, Dhavan said, but if you jail him, you will make him a martyr. 'Do not make Prashant Bhushan a martyr,' Dhavan submitted before the bench.</p><p> </p>In conclusion, Dhavan advised...",

        "articleBody": "<p>Substantive policy changes and a change in signalling is required if India truly wants to be an export-oriented and self-reliant economy according to Dr Arvind Panagariya Professor, Columbia University and Former Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. With the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affecting the economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign to use the slowdown as an opportunity to become economically self-reliant.</p><p>'We need to change the optics a bit. If we truly want to be an export-oriented economy, then there has to be signalling and substantive policy changes,' Dr Panagariya told BOOM in an interview adding that South Korea's transition to an export-oriented economy in the 1960s can be used as a reference point in India. </p><p>Under President Park Chung-hee, South Korea set up an Export Promotion Subcommittee which mobilized support for exports. The EPSC included ministry officials, industry chambers, exporters and banking officials. The EPSC focused on examining problems faced by manufacturers and exporters and as a result influenced policy proposals of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p><p>'We ought to do something like that. If there is review of that kind where even progress is assessed by the PM's committee, that sends a huge signal,' Dr Panagariya said.</p><p>'When we also simultaneously say we'll do import substitution, which is what we have been doing, then the signal gets mixed up. Policy-wise also it doesn't help. The signal has to be very clear. I think our signals are still mixed in addition to the policy barriers we face,' he added. </p><p>With the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, there is a danger of falling for the import substitution trap with domestic products given preference over foreign imports. Dr Panagariya has been a vocal opponent of the import substitution policy and believes that the policy goes against India's ambitions of being an export powerhouse.</p><p>'We cannot be an export powerhouse without being open to importing. The reason we fall into import substitution is that the producers often drive the policy. For the producers to capture a market, all they need to do is keep the imports out. As long as the imports are kept out, the market is there for the taking. That also seems plausible to the government.</p><p>'What we do not realize is that in doing so, we are effectively letting our less efficient producers to get into the market. These are typically not going to be global-sized manufacturers. We have done that in the last five-six years,' Dr Panagariya said, </p><p>'When we do this, what we are doing is taking the resources out of the industries where we are much more competitive and into the ones where we are not. And generally, these are the export industries,' he added.</p><p><b>Weaning Off China</b></p><p>The June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers at the Galwan valley which resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was followed by a strong anti-China sentiment in the country. The skirmish led to calls for a boycott of Chinese goods and technology in India. However, with China accounting for 12% of India's imports, boycotting Chinese products will end up disrupting Indian supply lines. Dr Panagariya is of the opinion that a gradual decoupling is required while also looking at alternative markets for Indian goods.</p><p>'We should move away from China gradually and we can do that if we forge trade relations with large number of other countries. Within Asia-Pacific we've got Japan, South Korea, Australia and also a number of ASEAN countries.'</p><p>Dr Panagariya also believes that forging a trade agreement with the European Union over the US will be more beneficial to India given the lack of conflicting trade interests like footwear, apparel and agriculture. However, India will need to open the market for European goods like automobiles and spirits.</p><p>'The UK is another market that we can have a free trade agreement with. Gradually if we do those two and maybe even Canada and Australia, confidence will be built up. We will then be ready for a similar agreement with the US. In that process, it also allows us to liberalise and that sends a signal that India wants to be an open economy,' Dr Panagariya added.</p><p><b>The Shenzhen Model</b></p><p>Even though India aims to decrease its dependency on China, it could learn from its neighbour on how to maximize its manufacturing and trade potential. According to Dr Panagariya, The port city of Shenzhen can act as a blueprint for Autonomous Economic Zones in India which will help in achieving their aims under the Aatmanirbhar Abhiyan.</p><p>In the 1980s, the coastal city of Shenzhen was marked as a Special Economic Zone as an experiment to introduce market-oriented reforms. As an SEZ, Shenzhen had economic policies focusing on land use, foreign exchange and business autonomy framed specially drafted for it. This led to a growth in foreign investment and rapid development as a global technology hub.</p>'The model that I am influenced by is the Shenzhen model of China. Take two or three coastal areas wh...",

In a supplementary affidavit filed on August 24, Bhushan indicated that he stood by what he said. Any apology 'would be insincere' and retraction of his statement would be a 'contempt' to his 'conscience', Bhushan said.</p><p>  </p><p>Bhushan said that his tweets 'represented this bonafide belief' that he continues to hold. 'Public expression of these beliefs was I believe, in line with my higher obligations as a citizen and a loyal officer of this court. Therefore, an apology for expression of these beliefs, conditional or unconditional, would be insincere,' he added. 'If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution that I hold in the highest esteem,' the supplementary statement read.   </p><p>  </p><p>'I believe that the SC is the last bastion of hope for the protection of fundamental rights, the watchdog institutions and indeed for constitutional democracy itself. It has rightly been called the most powerful court in the democratic world. Today in these troubling times, the hopes of the people of India vest in this Court to ensure the rule of law and the Constitution and not an untrammeled rule of the executive,' Bhushan said. 'When there's a deviation, This casts a duty...to speak up...,' he added.   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Not asking for Mercy, Cheerfully submit to penalty</b></p><p>On August 20, while hearing arguments on sentencing, the bench led by Justice Arun Mishra advised Bhushan to take 'two to three days' to reconsider the statement he made during the hearing on sentencing. At the time, Bhushan had said, 'The statement I made was well-considered and thought out. It is unlikely there shall be a change. I don't want to waste your time.' </p><p>Paraphrasing Mahatma Gandhi's submission from his 1922 sedition trial, Bhushan had said that he was not asking for 'mercy' and he would 'cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted' for 'what the Court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.'</p><p>Attorney General KK Venugopal, who also participated in the proceedings, had observed that Bhushan must not be punished.</p><p>The top court is likely to pronounce the sentence in Bhushan's case soon.</p><p>   </p><p><b>Tweets 'false, malicious and scandalous'</b></p><p>On August 14, the Supreme Court held Bhushan in criminal contempt over two tweets\u2014published in July\u2014which it found 'false, malicious and scandalous'. The top court had initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against Bhushan observing that his tweets brought 'the administration of justice in disrepute' and were 'capable of undermining the dignity and authority' of the Institution and the office of the Chief Justice of India 'in particular\u2026'.  </p><p>The top court was hearing at least two cases of contempt against the activist lawyer. The second case against Bhushan is a suo moto contempt against Bhushan about an 11-year-old interview in Tehelka where the senior lawyer alleged corruption in the higher judiciary including half of 16 CJIs.</p>  ",

        "articleBody": "<p>Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, the biopic of Flight Lieutenant (retd) Gunjan Saxena which released recently on Netflix, has stirred up a hornet's nest following claims of inaccuracy. The film claims to be inspired by a true story of the first woman officer of Indian Air Force (IAF) who went to war but members of Indian Armed Forces have already called out the film for its inauthenticity in depiction, including the portrayal of rampant sexism amongst its officers.</p><p>Saxena's course mate Flight Lieutenant (retd) Sreevidya Rajan has also called the film incorrect and biased. </p><p><b>Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl Revolves Around...</b></p><p>The film shows Gunjan Saxena as the first woman officer of the IAF to have flown a helicopter and participate in casualty evacuation operations during the Kargil War between India and Pakistan in 1999. It also depicts Saxena as the first woman to have been posted at the Udhampur Air Force Base, where she faces sexism and unfair treatment from fellow pilots of her unit and their commanding officer. Saxena is shown to have not been provided with a ladies changing room or washroom. The film further shows how she misses out on multiple sorties because of discrimination from the male officers at the Air Force base. Gunjan has to arm wrestle her fellow officers to prove her 'strength'. And she rescues her commanding officer from certain death when his helicopter is shot down during an evacuation operation.</p><p>A fact check throws up contradictions and interesting details. By definition, a biopic is a film about the life of a real person. In practice, filmmakers and producers across the world dramatise and adapt biopics to enhance appeal for audiences.  </p><p><b>Was Gunjan Saxena Really The First Woman Officer To Fly In Combat ?</b></p><p>This is the moot question because it is the key selling point for the film. And it appears the claim is being contested. </p><p>Wing Commander (Rtd) Anupama Joshi was among the first women officers of the IAF and had been consulted on this film for etiquette and protocol details. She told BOOM, 'We were the first women to have joined the Indian Armed Forces in 1992, including the Army, Navy and Air Force, and were assigned ground duties. The Air Force wanted to see how women adapt to the Forces, how men also adapt with women. The first batch of women with flying duties came in 1994.' </p><p>But it is also true that Sreevidya Rajan and Gunjan Saxena were the first women officers from IAF to fly in a combat zone. They flew Cheetah helicopters from Srinagar for rescue operations and communications tasks, supply drops. Saxena and Rajan are from the fourth course (batch) intake of 1994. There were six women pilots in their course. Because they were posted and trained at the Udhampur base in high altitude flying, they flew combat. Rajan claims she is the first woman officer to have flown in Kargil and IAF hasn't denied this claim. BOOM contacted IAF spokesperson Indranil Nandi to crosscheck details of records maintained by them and are yet to hear from them. We will update the story when IAF gets back with the details.   </p><p><b>Who Is Flight Lieutenant (Retd) Sreevidya Rajan ?</b></p><p>Flight Lieutenant (Retd) Sreevidya Rajan was Gunjan's colleague at the same time and has publicly expressed surprise at Gunjan's portrayal as the first woman officer.</p><p>Rajan told BOOM, 'Gunjan and I are course mates. Six of us trained in our course, and we got commissioned as pilot officers in 1996.We are the 4th course of women pilots and the second course of women helicopter pilots. Gunjan and I were posted to Udhampur base and we have flown in high altitude sectors in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. When Kargil broke out, we were experienced pilots, and were deployed to Srinagar. I was part of the first set and Gunjan was part of the replacement set. Naturally I was the first woman to operate in the Kargil sector. The film shows only one woman pilot being posted to Udhampur base.' </p><p>A popular broadcast news story by NDTV journalist Vishnu Som features both Gunjan Saxena and Sreevidya Rajan as women combat pilots in Kargil, with a sound byte from Saxena in 1999. The film is believed to have been inspired by this story. As the story was shot at an air force base, presenting Gunjan Saxena and Sreevidya Rajan to the media appeared to be organised by the IAF. </p><p><b>Did Gunjan Saxena Rescue Her Commanding Officer Who Discriminated Against Her ?</b></p><p>The film shows Gunjan Saxena suffering the brunt of sexist behaviour from a commanding officer, played by Vineet Singh in the film, who was eventually rescued by her when his helicopter was shot down in the Kargil war zone. Joshi disputes this incident and claims that the incident never happened during the war. </p><p><b>Were There No Separate Washrooms & Changing Rooms For Women Officers?</b></p><p>The film highlights the problems faced by Saxena because of no dedicated changing rooms, including turning up late for a sortie on several occasions because she could not change into a flying suit  in time. </p>IAF spokesperson Indranil Nand...",

The foreigners were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, Diseases Management Act and the Foreigners Act.   </p><p>  </p><p>Six Indians\u2014including trustees at Masjids\u2014were booked as well for allegedly sheltering the foreign nationals. The August 21 HC judgment quashed the FIRs against them as well.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Justice Nalawade in the judgment pulled up the media for their 'unwarranted' propaganda against the 'so-called religious activities' observing that print and electronic media ran propaganda against the foreigners who attended the Markaz. He noted, 'an attempt was made to create a picture that these foreigners were responsible for spreading COVID-19 virus in India,'</p><p>   </p><p>   </p><p>The court observed, 'The allegations against the Tablighi members suggest that instead of helping them we lodged them in jails by making allegations that they are responsible for violation of travel documents, they are responsible for spreading of virus etc.' Speaking about the media coverage of the Jamaat members and the Markaz, the HC said, it was 'high time the concerned,repent about this action taken against the foreigners and take some positive steps to repair the damage done by such action.'</p><p>  </p><p>The Tablighi Jamaat faced heavy backlash and was accused of being a carrier of the virus and spreading the infection to many states after several members of the Jamaat attended a religious congregation in Nizamuddin, Delhi in March, tested positive for novel Coronavirus. The religious congregation - markaz was held despite the government announcing a nationwide lockdown and restrictions of large gatherings to control the spread of the Coronavirus. The Tablighi Jamaat members were also discriminated against by various pieces of misinformation with news agencies also spreading fake news against the Jamaat members.</p><p>   </p><p>  </p><p>Quashing the cases against the foreigners who attended the Jamaat, the division bench noted, 'Maharashtra police acted mechanically, under political compulsion and on such instructions probably of the executive.' In June and August, the high courts of Madras and Karnataka respectively quashed similar proceedings against those who had participated in the March jamaat. The Madras HC had noted that the foreigners had 'suffered enough for their transgression of law' and have a 'right to return to their native countries at the earliest opportunity'.</p><p>BOOM debunked videos, images and audio messages targetting Jamaat members and the Muslim community and in a study published in May found that a bulk of the 178 fact checks published around the pandemic, were communal rumours, with many false allegations against Muslims, of purposefully spreading the virus.

'These foreigners were virtually persecuted and chosen as scapegoats by a 'political government'. The court said that during a pandemic when we should have shown more tolerance and been sensitive towards our guest, the 'foreigners' were blamed for various things including, spreading of the virus.  </p><p>  </p><p>The court observed that 'considering the dates on which these persons were taken in custody,' the possibility that they were infected in India is higher as opposed to being already infected before they came. The court further noted that these visitors were screened at the airport before they were allowed to leave. 'The entire aforesaid exercise was done by the Central Government against the persons like petitioners with the presumption that they were already infected when that contention cannot be substantiated,' the court said.</p><p>Also Read:Zee Hindustan Peddles 2015 News As Recent, Adds False Communal Angle</p><p>  </p><p><b>Maha police acting on political compulsion, action against foreigners malice</b></p><p>The division bench noting that the Maharashtra police acted mechanically and under political compulsion added, the 'police also did not dare to exercise powers given to them under provisions of procedural law\u2026'.   </p><p>  </p>The court observed that initially, the police did not intend to go 'against the foreigners,' but 'subsequently after getting directions from Central Government, which are mentioned already, Maharashtra police gave F.I.Rs. and filed cases in those crimes.' Condemning the State, the HC said, 'the government cannot give different treatment to citizens of different religions of different countries' and added, 'The record shows that there was non-application of mind by police' and charge sheets were filed 'even when no record was available to make o...",

According to a report in Stat News, it is too soon to say if the damage in patients recovering from Covid-19 is transient or permanent, but cardiologists are worried.</p><p><b>Also Read: <a href='https://www.boomlive.in/videos/fact-file/battling-covid-19-a-first-person-account-by-dr-paul-garner-8972' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Battling COVID-19: A First-Person Account By Dr Paul Garner</a></b></p><p><b>Link Between COVID-19 And Cardiovascular Problems</b>For patients with pre-existing conditions like coronary diseases, blockages, and weak heart muscles, the mortality rate from COVID-19 is on the higher side. </p><p>While for patients who haven't had pre-existing heart conditions before COVID-19, there is a risk of developing a wide range of heart diseases like developing abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and higher incidence of muscle weakness (cardiomyopathy), elaborates Dr Gupta. </p><p>But he points out there is some data to show that the weakness in the heart muscles is a temporary phenomenon.'We don't have long-term studies to support these findings but there are a few reports that show heart functions can return to normal with the right medication,' he said.  </p><p>The few who develop heart problems because of COVID-19 belong to an older demographic which already has co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, pre-existing heart disease.</p><p>One of the major heart problems that are generally seen with COVID-19 is myocarditis which is caused when the heart muscles swell up. Though at this stage it's difficult to know the cause, Dr Gupta pointed out that data gathered from autopsy results suggest that it is the inflammation in the body that causes heart muscle injury and myocarditis, and not the other way around.</p><p>'So if there is a massive infection or a massive inflammation, which is happening in the body it does affect the heart also,' said Dr Gupta. </p><p><b>Other Longterm Effects Of COVID-19</b>Along with the heart, the other major organs affected by COVID-19 are the lungs and the coagulation system. 'With COVID-19, the blood becomes thicker because there are various changes in the coagulation pathway, and there is a higher incidence of having blood clots, which travel to the lungs and cause a high mortality rate,' said Dr Gupta. </p><p>Other long-term effects of COVID-19 have also been examined by several papers around the world. A team of doctors from Columbia University, which has seen a large number of COVID-19 patients since the pandemic's beginnings, collected examples of COVID-19 impact on organs. The paper showed that COVID-19 patients who have been discharged have to deal with multiple organ damage like blood clots, kidney damage and more.</p><p><b>Also read: <a href='https://www.boomlive.in/videos/fact-file/explained-covid-19-damages-multiple-organs-apart-from-lungs-8938' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Explained: COVID-19 Damages Multiple Organs Apart From Lungs</a></b>Other long term effects of COVID-19 range from myocardial problems, gastrointestinal problems and headaches. In an earlier interview with DataBaaz, Dr Jeenam Shah cited patients who were on a ventilator because of COVID-19 developed lung fibrosis later on, and need oxygen therapy at home.</p><p>Dr Gupta has had a firsthand experience with COVID-19, where he and his spouse developed a mild form of COVID-19. But he feels there is more hope of learning more about the virus in the future. He says, 'Every day new treatments are coming up, we know a lot more than what we knew six months ago, and six months later we will know a lot more than what we know today. So, I think it is very gratifying as a scientist, cardiologist, a doctor to see how everybody has come together.'</p><p><b>Highlights:</b>-Patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing heart problems. -Few reports suggest that these heart problems might be temporary. -The few who develop heart problems because of COVID-19 belong to an older demographic which already has comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, pre-existing heart disease.<i>Catch the full interview on YouTube or click on the link <a href='https://youtu.be/wBNTXfSL1lw' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here. </a></i></p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>Four-feet Ganesh idols, online darshan, distributing prasad by courier, conducting medical camps, and felicitating COVID-19 warriors - Mumbai's Sarvajanik Ganpati pandals are adopting new ways to celebrate a sombre 11-day Ganeshotsav in 2020. Slated to begin from August 22, Ganeshotsav which is celebrated with much fanfare in the city , will see subdued celebrations this year as the city follows the State government's guidelines for celebrating the festival during COVID-19 times. </p><p>While Mumbai's collective active case load decreases, its fatality rate stands at 5% which is way higher than the country's 1.9% and the state's 3.35%. </p><p>Till 11 AM, August 21, The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) received over 2350 permissions from pandals of which it has only approved 1820 while another 274 are still being reviewed. It has rejected 256 permission requests on grounds of them violating social distancing guidelines. In any given year, the city sees around 14,000 Ganesh pandals, several with idols as high as 25 feet.</p><p>This year, however, the government has asked that the idols be limited to four feet at the pandals while idols being brought home should be limited to two feet. Families and volunteers at the pandals have been requested to bring the murtis a few days before Chaturthi to avoid crowding at the idol warehouses. </p><p>Along with these, the <i>visarjan, </i>the immersion practices followed with much fanfare on the 11th day should be carried out in artificial lakes or ponds in the vicinity of the pandals. Beaches should be accessed only by residents staying within 1-2 kms. The city officials have prepared 167 artificial lakes while the city already has 70 natural immersion spots. For societies in containment zones, special provisions have been made for the same, a BMC spokesperson told BOOM. </p><p>Normally, family and pandal members, themselves, conduct the immersion process. This year, however, all the idols will be collected at one spot from where trained volunteers working with the civic body will complete the immersion process. </p><p>Every ward will have 7-8 idol collection sites wherein residents will be expected to leave their Ganesh idols. 'We wish that the citizens will complete all their immersion pujas at home so as to avoid crowding at the collection spots,' reads a circular released by the civic body on August 17. </p><p>Also Read:Explained: How Ganeshotsav Will Be Different In Maharashtra This Year</p>How Are The Famous Pandals Celebrating This Year? <p>Mumbai's Lalbaugcha Raja, GSB Seva Mandal, Andhericha Raja, Ganesh Galli, Chinchpoklicha Chintamani, Fortcha Raja are some of the few Ganesh pandals that witness a huge visitor turnout every year. This year, most of them have adopted live darshans via Youtube, their websites, or social media channels</p><p>The most famous Lalbaugcha Raja mandal has announced that it will not be celebrating the festival in its 87th year. Instead, the mandal is conducting plasma donation camps with KEM hospital between August 3 and August 31. </p><p>Chinchpoklicha Raja is going ahead with a silver idol whose darshan will only be available to volunteers and residents of the area. Devotees will have to strictly wear masks and follow social distancing norms. They will be felicitating COVID-19 warriors during the festival. </p><p>Mumbai's richest Ganpati mandal, GSB is going to courier the prasad of the pujas to the houses of the devotees. 'We are following sanitary precautions but no in-person darshans this year. All our pujas will air live on our channels. We are also only accepting applications for the pujas online,' said Ramesh Bhandarkar, Chairman of the GSB Mandal. </p><p>Both Ganesh Galli and GSB have planned in-house immersion instead of going to the beach for immersing the idols that they normally follow. Ganesh Galli known for its grand decorations promises to celebrate the festival next year with double the fanfare. </p>Also Read:Coronavirus LIVE Update: India's Cases Rise To \u202d\u202d29,05,823; 54,849 Dead",

        "articleBody": "<p>The New York Times coronavirus vaccine tracker states that there are at least 165 COVID-19 vaccines being developed, with 32 vaccines in human trials. And though not much is known about the efficacy of these vaccines, a positive outcome might be around the corner. 'Data from vaccine tests on monkeys shows that a successful vaccine might be around the corner in the next six to 12 months, said Dr Gagandeep Kang, about the vaccine race for COVID-19. </p><p>Dr Kang, a professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore detailed what a successful vaccine for COVID-19 will mean for the world in a discussion with Databaaz. <b>Successful Vaccine Is Just The Beginning</b></p><p>The World Health Organisation and the US FDA have agreed to licence vaccines which will prevent 50% of confirmed disease. But the development of a vaccine that works might just be the first step to ending the pandemic, said Dr Kang. The possibility of a perfect vaccine which works with one shot is very rare. Even when the vaccine has arrived, it might not work for everybody, especially people who have been immuno-compromised.</p><p>While these vaccines are tried mostly on young and healthy people, it has to be seen if the vaccine will work on the most affected of the lot, the elderly. </p><p>'The Oxford trial does include a small number of the elderly, while it will not be sufficient to give us efficacy data, we will get data on the immune response of the elderly from that trial,' added Dr Kang. </p><p><b>COVID-19 Vaccine Development</b></p><p>Dr Kang says the reason that several COVID-19 vaccines are nearly ready to be deployed within seven months of the pandemic is because of how slow the development of the ebola vaccine was. 'We had a vaccine that was sitting in the freezer, but it took us nine months to get all the paperwork in place to begin the evaluation of the vaccine. After that the world got together and said we weren't going to let that happen again,' she added. </p><p>But the fact that a major part of the world's resources was being directed towards vaccine development and not other sectors of public health is challenging. 'It almost seems like the world thinks that vaccines are going to be a panacea for everything. Once we have a vaccine. The problem is solved, but a lot more needs to be done,' concluded Dr Kang.</p><p><b>Cure For COVID-19</b></p><p>The COVID-19 mortality rate is not a result of the disease itself but because of the disregulated immune system. According to Dr Kang, to find a cure for COVID-19, it is very important to understand the virus, and also understand the disease process in people who are severely ill.</p><p>The first part of COVID-19 cure that needs to be looked at is the development of an anti-viral, like Remdesivir\u2014whether it should be used at earlier stages of the illness so that the patient doesn't slip into severe disease. </p><p>The other part of the cure is to look for pathways to control the severe stages of infection, like using the steroid dexamethasone. Dr Kang adds that it's important to look at different approaches to modulate mild and severe illness. </p><p><b>Highlights</b></p><p><b>-</b>The World Health Organisation and the US FDA has agreed to licence vaccines which prevent 50% confirmed disease.-While these vaccines are tried mostly on young and healthy people, it has to be seen if the vaccine will work on elderly and people who have been immunocompromised.- The COVID-19 mortality rate is not a result of the disease itself but because of the disregulated immune system. </p><p><i> Catch the full interview on YouTube or click on the link <a href='https://youtu.be/XhvF-mC9rrM' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here. </a></i></p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>Advocate Prashant Bhushan who was held in criminal contempt for scandalising the court has refused to apologise to the Supreme Court. 'My tweets were nothing but a small attempt to discharge what I considered to be my highest duty at this juncture in the history of our republic. I did not tweet in a fit of absence mindedness. It would be insincere and contemptuous on my part to offer an apology for the tweets that expressed what was and continues to be my bonafide belief', a statement prepared by Bhushan read before arguments began.  </p><p>  </p><p>Paraphrasing Mahatma Gandhi's submission from his 1922 sedition trial, Bhushan said: 'I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal to magnanimity. I am here, therefore, to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the Court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.'   </p><p>  </p><p>On August 14, the Supreme Court held Bhushan in criminal contempt over two tweets which scandalised the court. The top court had initiated contempt proceedings against Bhushan observing that his tweets brought 'the administration of justice in disrepute' and were 'capable of undermining the dignity and authority' of the Institution and the office of the Chief Justice of India 'in particular\u2026'.   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Expressing belief must be permissible in a </b><b>democracy</b></p><p>On August 19, Bhushan had filed a plea in the court seeking to defer the hearing scheduled for today on the grounds that he intended to challenge his conviction. When the hearing began on Thursday morning, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, one of the lawyers representing Bhushan, once again requested for a deferral, which was promptly denied.   </p><p>  </p><p>'In the event, we decide to impose any kind of punishment, we assure you that it won't be in operation till the review is decided. Don't worry, we will be fair to you... Even if you are not fair to us,' Justice Arun Mishra, who was leading the three-judge bench said.    </p><p>  </p><p>Before the hearing commenced, a statement prepared by Bhushan was read out in court by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan who also represented the lawyer.</p> <p><b>Balancing Act</b></p><p>After reading out the statement, Dhavan addressed the court submitting that while deciding on contempt, the intent and nature of not just the contemnor, but that of the offence must also be considered.   </p><p>  </p><p>'Tweets are transient in nature. They are like fireflies in the night. Can the SC explain how the tweets will substantially interfere with the administration of justice?, Dhavan asked. 'In contempt cases, truth is my absolute defence. In sentencing too, it will be my defence...,' he added.   </p><p>  </p><p>'If you do not balance your comments, you will destroy the institution. We do not punish for contempt so easily but there has to be a balance. There has to be some restraint. There is a Lakshman Rekha for everything. Why should you cross the Rekha?' Justice Mishra said.</p><p><b>Also Read:</b> All You Need To Know About Contempt of Court</p><p>   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Reconsider statement   </b></p><p>Midway through the hearing, the court asked Bhushan if he wanted to reconsider the statement he read out in the beginning. To which, Bhushan replied in the negative.   </p><p>  </p><p>'The statement I made was well-considered and thought out. It is unlikely there shall be a change. Don't want to waste your time,' Bhushan responded. The court, however, insisted on giving Bhushan two-three days to think about it.   </p><p>  </p><p>'It's better if you take the time. Take two-three days. We want to give you time. Then, later on, don't say we didn't give u time to reflect...If you stand by your statement, then alright, we will go by it,' Justice Mishra said.   </p><p>  </p><p>Attorney General KK Venugopal, who was also present, also sought pardon for Bhushan. 'I will request you not to punish Prashant Bhushan,' he told the three-judge bench.   </p><p>  </p><p>Concluding his arguments for the day, Dhavan said there was no justification or reasons given as to how the court concluded that the tweets were 'scurrilous'. Dhavan added that Bhushan's sentiment found support with more than lawyers and former judges.   </p><p>  </p><p>'Are they in contempt too?' Dhavan asked.   </p><p>   </p><p>Buttressing Dhavan's argument, Venugopal said, 'I have a list of nine judges who had said that there is corruption in the higher levels of the judiciary. I had myself said it in 1987..'   </p><p>  </p><p>The hearings then concluded with the bench giving Bhushan time to reflect and reconsider the statements he made. </p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>18.9 million Indians lost their salaried jobs between April to July this year, with 5 million of these jobs being lost in July alone. This data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy or CMIE comes at a time when the Indian economy is limping back to normalcy from a COVID-19 induced lockdown. Agricultural jobs, however, seem to be better off than jobs in business, salaried classes and daily wage earners; gaining 14.9 million jobs in the same period.</p><p>Overall, at the very start of the lockdown in April, the Indian economy lost 121.5 million jobs due to shock imposed by the lockdown, but the CMIE notes that this loss has narrowed to 11 million. </p><p>'What happened in April was that there was an immediate impact of a massive shock to the economy which led to 403 million who had employment get hit. And of those 403 million people, 121 million people lost their jobs', said CMIE's MD and CEO, Mahesh Vyas to BOOM's Govindraj Ethiraj. </p><p>Most of these shifts can be attributed to the structure of the Indian workforce, Vyas explained. </p><p>When the economy faces a shock, its the daily wage earners who are impacted first. This implies that occupations such as carpentry or mason, for example, would be first on the chopping block. Compared to this, salaried individuals' jobs are retained for a period even after their companies fall in trouble, thus creating a lag. Therefore, once the lockdown started lifting, the informal jobs started trickling in; farmers are carrying out agricultural work after witnessing good rains; but salaried jobs are being lost as they are being hit with this lag. Salaried jobs are hard to lose, but are also hard to retrieve, said Vyas. </p><p>'Companies are slowly shutting down, as they are slowly seeing the impact of the lockdown to be more severe than what they anticipated earlier. The lockdown has been more prolonged than what anyone imagined in the beginning', he said. </p><p>In April, at the onset of the lockdown, 17.7 million salaried jobs were lost. An additional 0.1 million were lost in May but 3.9 million jobs were gained in June. Another 5 million jobs were lost in July, bringing the net loss to salaried jobs in this period to 18.9 million, making this number 22% lower than their level in the last fiscal. </p><p>The agricultural sector fared much better. In March and April, the sector employed 117 million people. In May, this figure inched up to 118.5 million, only to shoot up to 130 million in June and settle at 126 million in July. </p><p>'If you don't get anything anywhere, you got back home to your villages and you have some mud to shovel around', Vyas states, while explaining this resilience in the agricultural sector. 'Then you say you are employed on your farm over there,' said Vyas.</p><p>Also Read:Employment Rate On The Rise, But Not Salaried Jobs: Mahesh Vyas</p><p>But even those who have not lost their jobs, have lost a part of their purchasing power. 'The wage increases will be low, or negligible, or there may be a pay cut', he says. Even if income from wages remain stable, there could be losses elsewhere, such as in valuation or sentiment. </p><p>But it is not too late for the government to lend a cushion, as Vyas reiterates a previous estimate of a payout of \u20b910,000 to affected families for 2 months as a support measure.</p><p>CMIE's release can be found here. </p>Good days for large companies ahead?<p>A shift in Indian employment is over the horizon, according to Vyas.</p><p>'When you have a shock of this kind, and this is the third shock in four years, only the large companies are going to survive', he said. </p><p>Small and medium businesses will shut down, due to this, yielding space to larger companies; seeing their market share increase. A by-product of this phenomenon is that the large companies, with their increased market share, would not necessarily absorb the lost labour, and they would go in for automation as they are more capable of doing so. </p><p>For some companies, and some sectors, this is irreversible, as it becoming clearer that small companies will be unable to survive this. </p><p>The interview with Mahesh Vyas can be watched below.</p>",

Energy and power-related PSUs rule the roost, with oil and gas exploration company ONGC and power-generation company NTPC donating \u20b9300 crores and \u20b9250 crores respectively. The information also shows that many PSUs, such as ONGC and oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (abbreviated HPCL, which is owned by ONGC) have dipped into their CSR (corporate social responsiblity) funds, which are yet to be earmarked for the ongoing financial year.  </p><p>IE filed RTI queries with 55 PSUs, and received 38 responses, with the data pertaining to the period March 27 to August 13.  </p><p>These numbers are significant, as the PM CARES fund has been facing flak for not being transparent about the true extent of the donations it has received since being established on March 27 this year. This leaves only estimates of the holistic and actual collection for the fund, with the Prime Minister's Office repeatedly mentioning that the fund does not fall under the purview of the RTI Act. This was once again shown in a response obtained by IE. When the fund was established, its also faced questions on doing so in the first place due to the presence of a pre-existing Prime Minister's National Relief Fund. </p><p><b>Also Read:</b>PM Cares Vs PM National Relief Fund: All You Need To Know</p><p>The fund shows through its website that it has collected \u20b93,076.62 crores in 2019 - 2020 (a period of 5 days since its establishment). No donors have been identified. It has allocated \u20b93,100 crores: \u20b92,000 crores for 50,000 ventilators, \u20b91,000 crores for the care of migrant labourers and \u20b9100 crores towards vaccine development. The allocation is not constrained to particular time period. </p><p>The contribution of these 38 PSUs can be seen below.</p>CSR Funds<p>The RTI responses reveal that PSUs across the spectrum have dipped into the funds categorised as CSR to contributes to the PM CARES in various capacities.The website states that allocations made towards it can be classified as CSR contribution, with the fund also offering a 100% tax exemption to contributions.</p><p><b><span class='read-this-also'>Also Read:</span></b>Supreme Court Rules Out Fund Transfer From PM CARES Fund To NDRF</p><p>ONGC has mentioned that it has offered funds from its CSR budget for this year, even though this allocation is 'yet to be determined'. HPCL has admitted to contributing \u20b9120 crores from its CSR budget for the ongoing financial year which is yet to be finalised. </p><p>Power Finance Corporation was one PSU that contributed more than its CSR allocation. While its contribution this financial year has been \u20b9200 crores towards the fund, its CSR budget estimate for the the ongoing year is just north of \u20b9150 crores. </p><p>Last (financial) year, the Airports Authority of India also contributed \u20b915 crores from a CSR allocation of \u20b983.79 crores.</p><p>Some PSUs have dipped into their CSR budgets across financial years: the ongoing and previous one.</p><p>OIL India Limited has contributed \u20b913 crores in the previous financial year, and \u20b925 crores in the ongoing one.

        "articleBody": "<p>As India inches closer to reporting 3 million cases, several people who tested positive for COVID-19 are advised home isolation as opposed to getting admitted in any COVID-19 care facilities. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued specific guidelines for both home quarantine as well as home isolation. </p><p>Home isolation is after a person tests positive and is asked to continue treatment from home. Quarantine on the other hand, is for people who have either recently travelled, or are contacts of positive people and are likely to have been exposed to the virus but are not confirmed to be positive. They are asked to follow strict social distancing norms. In quarantine, minimal movement around the house is permitted, but in isolation the person is expected to stay within a confined space even within the house. </p><p>In Mumbai, at the beginning of the pandemic, when the cases increased in the slum areas,  several positive patients were sent to COVID-19 care centres. After contact tracing, the people at risk were sent to special quarantine facilities. As the number increased in the buildings, the instances of COVID-19 home isolation, increased. </p><p>On August 19, Mumbai issued additional home isolation guidelines stating that people over the age of 50 will not be allowed home isolation. 'This decision was taken to reduce Mumbai's mortality rate as people with or without co-morbidities in the age group above 50 have been more vulnerable to succumbing to the disease,' said Dr. Mangala Gomare, Executive Health Officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).</p>Also Read:COVID-19 Outbreak: Difference Between Quarantine And Isolation<p>'Individuals who are asymptomatic, or exhibiting mild and moderate symptoms and have the feasibility and space to be isolated at home, are asked to isolate themselves from their families at home,' said Dr. Daksha Shah, Deputy Executive Health Officer, BMC.</p><p>The BMC follows the Centre's guidelines while assessing whether a particular individual should follow home isolation or should be sent to an available facility. 'As soon as we are notified of a case, the medical officers of the health posts from the specific wards visit with a team and take a detailed medical history. Even if a person does not have co-morbidities, we suggest institutional isolation if others in the family have any health issues,' explained Dr.Shah. </p><p>Home isolation was also debated in Delhi in the month of June. While the Kejriwal government wanted home isolation for positive COVID-19 patients, the Governor, Lt. Anil Baijal had issued an order that every positive patient irrespective of whether they were asymptomatic, or exhibited mild/moderate symptoms had to visit a COVID-19 care facility. The Kejriwal government was not in support of this rule as they thought it would put an additional strain on the health facilities. </p><p>After deliberations, this order was scrapped and the Governor issued an order to permit home isolation. In a statement the LG's office wrote, 'for those who test positive through RT-PCR Test, the patient shall be allowed home isolation if, as per the assessment of Home Isolation team sent by the District Surveillance Officer (DSO), the patient is mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic and has a residence of two rooms or a separate room and a separate toilet for the patient. He/she will be provided a contact number for any consultation required by him along with details of CATS Ambulance call number for transfer to hospital in case symptoms develop.'</p><p><b>Ministry Rules For Home Isolation</b></p><p>The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued specific guidelines for home isolation which includes the following points:</p><p>-The person should be clinically assigned as a very mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic case by the treating medical officer.</p><p>-Should have the requisite facility at their residence for self-isolation and also for quarantining the family contacts.</p><p>- Should not be immuno-compromised (HIV, Transplant recipients, Cancer therapy etc) </p><p>- Should be less than 60 years</p><p>- Should not have any co-morbid conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart disease, Chronic lung/liver/ kidney disease, Cerebro-vascular disease etc. They shall only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer.</p><p>- Should have a care giver who could connect with the hospital for the entire duration of home isolation.</p><p>The patients are asked to fill an undertaking on self-isolation and follow home quarantine rules. The positive individuals have to wear a triple- layered mask which should be changed every 8 hours and stay isolated in a designated area far away from the other members of the house. Following basic hand hygiene, along with cleaning surfaces that they touch is another home isolation guideline. </p>The patients are also expected to download the Aarogya Setu app. Along with this, the individuals are asked to self- monitor their health by monitoring their temperature daily.

        "articleBody": "<p>The Supreme Court on August 19 dismissed a plea filed by actress Rhea Chakraborty seeking to transfer the investigation in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput from Bihar to Mumbai. On June 25, Rajput's father Krishna Kishore Singh had filed an FIR in Patna against Chakraborty and her family holding them responsible for his son's death. The Bihar state had subsequently transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for further probe.   </p><p>  </p><p>'\u2026the Patna police committed no illegality in registering the Complaint. Looking at the nature of the allegations in the Complaint which also relate to misappropriation and breach of trust, the exercise of jurisdiction by the Bihar Police appears to be in order,' Justice Hrishikesh Roy observed bringing an end to the jurisdictional tussle between Bihar and Maharashtra.  </p><p>  </p><p>The top court also upheld Bihar state's decision to transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) 'to ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter\u2026'.   </p><p>  </p><p>Mumbai police\u2014which was also probing the matter\u2014has been directed to hand over all the material evidence collected so far and assist the CBI in their investigation. Any other case registered in connection with Rajput's death will also be probed by the CBI.   </p><p>  </p><p>The single-judge bench had reserved its order on August 11 after hearing detailed submissions by Bihar and Maharashtra Police, Rajput's father, Chakraborty and the Centre (for CBI).    </p><p>  </p><p>ON June 14, the 34-year-old Chhichore star was found dead in his rented Bandra apartment. News reports suggested that Rajput allegedly suffered from depression, with some inside the Bollywood industry going as far as speculating that nepotism was its cause.     </p><p>  </p><p><b>What the court said on transfer of case to CBI  </b></p><p>An accused cannot choose the investigating agency, the court observed. In the matter pertaining to Rajput's death, 'political interference against both states is alleged which has the potential of discrediting the investigation.'   </p><p>  </p><p>'Transfer of investigation to the CBI cannot be a routine occurrence but should be in exceptional circumstances' Justice Roy observed. He added that retaining 'public confidence in the impartial working of the State agencies' is a 'relevant' factor that must be 'considered' for 'induction of the Central Agency'.   </p><p>  </p><p>'While the CBI cannot conduct any investigation without the consent of the concerned state as mandated under section 6, the powers of the Constitutional Courts are not fettered by the statutory restriction of the DSPE Act,' the 35-paged verdict read.    </p><p>  </p><p>This Court 'must strive to ensure that search for the truth is undertaken by an independent agency, not controlled by either of the two state governments' in light of the 'the apprehension voiced by the stakeholders of unfair investigation'. 'Most importantly, the credibility of the investigation and the investigating authority, must be protected,' the court said.    </p><p>  </p><p><b>The turf war between state police   </b></p><p>'The conflict between the two State governments on, who amongst the two is competent to investigate the case, is apparent here,' Justice Roy observed. Mumbai police has attempted to stretch 'the purview of Section 174 (investigation in an unnatural death) without drawing up any FIR,' the judge said, 'they are yet to register a FIR...'.   </p><p>  </p><p>'Therefore, it is pre-emptive and premature to hold that a parallel investigation is being carried out by the Mumbai Police,' the judge added.   </p><p>  </p><p>'\u2026Because both states are making acrimonious allegations of political interference against each other, the legitimacy of the investigation has come under a cloud,' the court said. 'Accusing fingers are being pointed and people have taken the liberty to put out their own conjectures and theories' leading to 'speculative public discourse which have hogged media limelight'.   </p><p>  </p><p>'These developments, unfortunately, have the propensity to delay and misdirect the investigation. In such a situation, there is a reasonable apprehension of truth being a casualty and justice becoming a victim,' Justice Roy said.   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Justice prevails in sunlight  </b></p><p>'The actor Sushant Singh Rajput was a talented actor in the Mumbai film world and died well before his full potential could be realised. His family, friends and admirers are keenly waiting the outcome of the investigation so that all the speculations floating around can be put to rest. Therefore, a fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour. The expected outcome then would be, a measure of justice for the Complainant, who lost his only son,' the court said.   </p><p>  </p><p>It added: 'When truth meets sunshine, justice will not prevail on the living alone but after Life's fitful fever, now the departed will also sleep well. Satyameva Jayate.'   </p>",

Incidentally, advocate Prashant Bhushan was held in contempt over tweets that were brought to the judiciary's attention by a plea filed by Maheshwari, who hails from Guna, Madhya Pradesh.   </p><p>  </p><p>On August 14, the Supreme Court held advocate Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt over two tweets which scandalised the court. The hearing on sentencing is scheduled for August 20. The apex court observed that it would not remain a 'silent spectator' when statements are made 'in order to malign the image of the judiciary'.   </p><p><b>What is contempt of court?<br></b></p><p>Contempt of court is a legal mechanism to protect the judiciary from motivated and unwarranted attacks and punishes those who attempt to lower its authority.   </p><p>  </p><p>According to the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, contempt of court can be civil or criminal. Willful disobedience or breach of a court order, judgment, decree, direction, writ or an undertaking given to court amounts to civil contempt.   </p><p>  </p><p>Publication of any material (words, spoken, written, signs, visible representations, an act or in any manner or form) that (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court; (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner is considered to be criminal contempt.   </p><p>  </p><p>Contempt of court attracts a simple punishment for a term up to six months, or a fine, or both. However, contempt maybe discharged, or the punitive action waived off if the person accused of contempt makes an apology that satisfies the court.   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Challenge to this act   </b></p><p>On August 1, senior journalist N. Ram, former union minister Arun Shourie and advocate Prashant Bhushan challenged section 2(c)(i) of the act which attracts punitive action for the publication of any matter that could scandalise the court or lower its authority. The plea submitted that the impugned section was vague, manifested arbitrariness and violated the fundamental right of freedom of speech.   </p><p>  </p><p>'\u2026The offence of 'scandalizing the court' is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects, which have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism and the maintenance of an open robust public sphere,' the plea read. </p><p>  </p><p>However, two weeks later, the plea was withdrawn. The withdrawal came after the Supreme Court sought an explanation from the registry officials as to why the plea was listed before a bench other than Justice Arun Mishra's which was already hearing similar cases.   </p><p>  </p><p><b>Criticism against contempt of court   </b></p><p>There are two aspects to contempt of court. While experts have maintained the importance for civil contempt \u2013 this ensures the judicial authority is not circumvented, criminal contempt has faced criticism. In an opinion piece for The Hindu, former high court judge AP Shah spoke about the 'chilling effect of criminal contempt' even as he along with at least 139 others, including 10 former judges from the higher judiciary, endorsed a statement supporting Bhushan.   </p><p>  </p><p>In supporting Bhushan, the endorsement letter criticised the top court on its 'reluctance' to 'play its constitutionally mandated role as a check on governmental excesses and violations of fundamental rights of people by the state.'</p><p><b>Held in contempt   </b></p>Like Bhushan, Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy is not a stranger to contempt cases. On March 6, 2002 the apex court bench comprising Justices GB Pattnaik and RP Sethi held her guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced her to simple imprisonment in Tihar Jail for one day. A fine of Rs. 2000 was also imposed on her, which if she failed ...",

        "articleBody": "<p>The Supreme Court on August 18 ruled that funds collected in the name of COVID-19 relief in the PM CARES Fund cannot be transferred to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). The two are entirely different funds with different object and purpose, the three-judge bench observed. The fund did not violate NDRF norms, the top court said.</p><p>The top court's verdict came on a plea filed by advocacy rights group Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) which sought the transfer of funds and the drawing up of a National Plan under the NDRF to combat the pandemic brought on by the coronavirus.   </p><p>The Centre could also utilise funds from the NDRF for providing assistance in the fight of COVID-19 pandemic by way of releasing funds at the request of the states as per the new guidelines, the judgment said.</p><p>Responding to the verdict, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said 'transparency was writ large in PM-Cares Fund both in terms of legal requirement and transparent management of funds received on a voluntary basis... Unnecessary targeting of the PM-CARES fund has been done in the high court and in the Supreme Court.' Hitting out at Congress, Prasad said 'Rahul Gandhi has been doing this based on what his advisors. Rahul Gandhi has continuously been making statements to weaken the country on multiple fronts. Rahul Gandhi has left no stone unturned to weaken the country's resolve in the fight against Coronavirus.</p><p>The Centre set up the PM CARES Fund on March 28, days after it announced a nationwide lockdown. The fund was set up as a public charitable trust with the primary objective of handling any kind of COVID-19-related emergency or distress situation.  In its petition, the CPIL had maintained that 'Even though there is a provision for NDRF under Section 46 of the Disaster Management Act, the central government has come up with a PM CARES Fund. All the contributions being made by individuals and institutions in relation to COVID-19 crisis are being credited into the PM CARES Fund and not to the NDRF, in clear violation of Section 46 of the DM (Disaster Management) Act.'   </p><p>Responding to the plea, the Centre had said, 'Mere existence of a statutory fund (NDRF) would not prohibit creation of a different fund like PM CARES Fund which provides for voluntary donations.'  </p><p>During the hearing, questions of auditing the fund had arisen. 'This government believes in transparency. Why should private auditors audit it (PM CARES)? NDRF, under DM Act, is audited by CAG (Comptroller and Audit General),' senior advocate Dushyant Dave said, representing CPIL. </p><p>On August 14, the Modi government denied information on the PM CARES Fund under the Right to Information (RTI) Act on the grounds that it would 'disproportionately divert resources'.</p><p>RTI activist Commodore Lokesh Batra has filed multiple requests seeking information on the PM CARES Fund and the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF). In one of his requests filed with the PMO, Batra sought information on the number of queries it received since April 2020 on the PM CARES Fund and the PMNRF, and how many were disposed of. On August 14, the authorities denied him this information on the grounds that the information sought for is 'not maintained in this office in compiled form.'</p><p>The PMO cited section 7(9) to block information, even as several high courts and central information commission rulings say that the section in question is not an exemption clause. </p><p>  </p>",

        "articleBody": "<p>An article in the Wall Street Journal accusing Facebook of overlooking infringements of its own hate-speech policies in India fearing a backlash from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has triggered a major political row in the country.</p><p>The story, titled 'Facebook's Hate-Speech Rules Collide With Indian Politics', published on August 14, 2020 stated that Facebook India's Public Policy head Ankhi Das advised the platform against taking action against hate speech by members of the BJP, to avoid 'damaging the company's business prospects in the country'.</p><p>This matter has now turned into a major political storm in the country, with opposition members and Union cabinet ministers sparring on Twitter.</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook did not respond till the time of publication. BOOM is part of Facebook's third-party fact-checking program, which is separate from Facebook's content moderation policies that WSJ's article talks about. </p>'Damage The Company's Business Prospects'<p>According to the WSJ article, Das told Facebook employees that 'punishing violations by politicians from Mr. Modi's party would damage the company's business prospects in the country.'</p><p>The article said that employees had flagged a Facebook post about Rohingya Muslims by T Raja - a BJP MLA from Telangana- as possible incitement to violence and found him falling under the company's  'Dangerous Individuals and Organizations' policy, which would result in a permanent ban from the platform. His page, however, still remains.</p><p>WSJ further alleged that the company removed questionable posts by Raja only after it was approached for comments for the article. Raja, in turn, denied any wrongdoings and claimed that his account was hacked in 2018.</p><p>BJP MP Ananthkumar Hegde from Karnataka and party member Kapil Mishra from Delhi, also had several posts from their respective pages removed by Facebook, after the company was approached for comments by the publication, the WSJ article said. It was mentioned in the article that both Mishra and Hegde have a history of disseminating hate speech on social media.</p><p>In February, Mishra gave a highly publicised speech in presence of law enforcement, to warn that if the demonstrations against a new amendment to the citizenship act were not cleared, his supporters would do so by force. The speech came shortly before certain areas in north east Delhi was engulfed in sectarian violence which claimed more than 40 lives. </p><p>The video of the speech was later taken down by Facebook.</p><p>The WSJ article also added examples to show Das' personal bias towards Modi and the BJP, to draw a link between her political views and her actions as a high-level Facebook employee towards hate speech by Modi's party members. It stated that Das had previously written an article praising Modi, and was also found sharing a post that called Indian Muslims a 'degenerate community'.</p><p>On Sunday, Das filed an FIR with Delhi Police (Cyber Cell), alleging that she had received multiple threats, including death threats, on social media, following the WSJ article.</p>Political Ramifications<p>The WSJ article quickly triggered a major political storm in India, with several opposition leaders calling for investigations into BJP's link with Facebook.</p><p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi went as far as to allege that the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) control Facebook and WhatsApp in India.</p><p>BJP & RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India.They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate.Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook. pic.twitter.com/Y29uCQjSRP</p>\u2014 Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) August 16, 2020<p>Ravi Shankar Prasad, the Union minister of Communications and Information Technology, responded by calling Gandhi a loser and instead pointed towards Congress' alleged involvement with former British political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica in the run up to the 2014 general elections.</p><p>Losers who cannot influence people even in their own party keep cribbing that the entire world is controlled by BJP & RSS. You were caught red-handed in alliance with Cambridge Analytica & Facebook to weaponise data before the elections & now have the gall to question us? https://t.co/NloUF2WZVY</p>\u2014 Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad) August 16, 2020<p>The government is yet to give an official statement regarding the details mentioned in the WSJ article, and its relation with Facebook.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shashi Tharoor also responded to Gandhi's tweet, stating that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, which he heads, would would take this matter up with Facebook.</p><p>Aam Aadmi Party legislator and Delhi's Peace and Harmony Committee head Raghav Chadha stated that concerned Facebook officials will be summoned by the committee to 'discern if there is any role or complicity of Facebook Officials in Delhi Riots'.</p>Delhi Legislative Assembly's Committee on Peace & Harmony has received complaints against officials of Facebook for their alleged...",
