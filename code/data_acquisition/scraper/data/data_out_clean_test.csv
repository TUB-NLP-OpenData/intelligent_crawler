0,6/17/2008,en,6/17/2008,Dry Drowning,Account of a 10-year-old boy's death explains dry drowning and its symptoms.,"CLAIM					Account of a 10-year-old boy's death explains dry drowning and its symptoms.									MixtureRATINGMixtureORIGINThe following item was the text of an article titled “Boy’s death highlights a hidden danger: Dry drowning” that was posted to the TodayShow.com site on 5 June 2008 and circulated widely online:The tragic death of a South Carolina 10-year-old more than an hour after he had gone swimming has focused a spotlight on the little-known phenomenon called “dry drowning” – and warning signs that every parent should be aware of.“I’ve never known a child could walk around, talk, speak and their lungs be filled with water,” Cassandra Jackson told NBC News in a story broadcast Thursday on TODAY.On Sunday, Jackson had taken her son, Johnny, to a pool near their home in Goose Creek, S.C. It was the first time he’d ever gone swimming — and, tragically, it would be his last.[Rest of article here.]Although the account is essentially true, the article contains some confusing elements that could send parents scuttling to protect their children from one danger when they should be trying to guard them against a quite different one. A 10-year-old boy named Johnny (“Jon Jon”) Jackson died as described above on 1 June 2008 in Goose Creek, South Carolina, subsequent to swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived. Although Johnny, a child who lived with autism and attention deficit disorder, was wearing flotation devices on his arms and was being monitored by his mother during his time in the pool, he did inhale some water while swimming; his mother described him as “taking a little bit of water in and coughing and then calming down.” He afterwards appeared fine, but less than two hours after leaving the pool he twice defecated in his pants and complained of being tired. After being bathed and dressing himself back at the apartment, the boy walked to his bed unaided, leaving his mother to believe he was simply worn out. Yet when his mother checked on Johnny a few minutes later, she discovered that white foam was issuing from his mouth, his lips were blue, and his tongue was sticking out. The family called 911, but the Johnny suffered cardiac arrest during transport to the hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at Trident Medical Center.  According to the coroner, water was found in Johnny’s lungs, and the cause of his death was listed as asphyxiation by drowning. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));While the article about Johnny’s death is factual, it contains one key element of confusion: Jon Jon Jackson was not technically a “dry drowning” victim, but rather a victim of “delayed drowning,” also termed “secondary drowning.” That distinction is important because numerous news articles that mentioned Johnny’s death and attributed it to dry drowning also supplied the information that dry drowning is responsible for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths, thereby making it seem as though the tragic circumstances that swept away this one particular child loom as a huge risk to other children. This is not the case: The incidence of delayed drowning (which is what killed Johnny) is relatively uncommon; the incidence of true dry drowning is much greater. The latter is therefore what adult swimmers and the parents of juvenile swimmers need be more concerned about, but that form of drowning was not truly described in the article about Johnny’s death.   Many news stories, by the way, indicate they drew the “ten to fifteen percent” figure from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC denies this, distancing itself from that particular factoid with this statement:UPDATE: Recent media reports have incorrectly attributed to CDC data about incidents of “dry drowning.” CDC supports international consensus defining drowning as “the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid” and does not distinguish between “wet” and “dry” drowning.The primary difference between dry drowning and secondary (or delayed) drowning is the presence or absence of water in the victim’s lungs. In Jon Jon Jackson’s case, he died with water in his lungs, so his death was more typical of “ordinary” drowning victims (i.e., water in the lungs prevented those organs from transporting oxygen into the bloodstream) even though he lived for a couple of hours after leaving the pool. By contrast, true dry drowning deaths do not involve the presence of liquid in the lungs.There are two primary theories as to what causes dry drowning, and it may well be that both are correct and that this form of death can be brought on in two different ways. The first theory is that a sudden rush of water into the throat causes the airway to snap shut, a condition known as a laryngospasm. During this event, although no water enters the lungs, no air enters either, so the victim dies of asphyxiation. The second explanation posits that the shock of a swimmer’s suddenly entering extremely cold water causes the heart to stop.Dry drowning accounts for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths. Considering that approximately 4,000 people drown in the U.S. each year, that means dry drowning kills about 400 to 600 U.S. victims annually. It therefore poses a significant enough mortality risk that those who swim (or who supervise swimmers) should know what can be done to decrease the chance of its happening to them or their loved ones.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));To help prevent dry drowning, keep your mouth closed when jumping or diving into water, thereby protecting the larynx from a sudden inrush of water that could cause it to spasm and cut off the airway. Also, do not dive or jump into extremely cold water; instead enter cold water gradually. Those who have a history of heart problems should avoid entering very cold water at all, even if they plan to go slowly.Drowning is the second most common cause of death in children in the United States. In addition to following the more usual cautions  (e.g., watch them like hawks all the time), caregivers of young swimmers should try to head off dry drowning by training their charges to keep their mouths closed when jumping into water and to enter very cold water slowly. Caregivers should also guard against delayed drowning by monitoring very closely any child who has come out of the water coughing and sputtering (signs of water having been breathed in), especially keeping an eye out for any further difficulties in breathing, extreme tiredness, or marked changes in behavior, all of which are signs that a swimmer may have inhaled a dangerous amount of fluid. Should such difficulties be noted in a swimmer, that person should be taken promptly to an emergency room for medical observation and, if necessary, intervention.One additional caution should be noted regarding drowning: It is a fallacy that those who lose their lives in such fashion will flail about wildly even as they are slipping beneath the water’s surface. Drowning generally occurs silently and smoothly, the victim quietly passing away wholly unnoticed as friends or family chatter nearby. Therefore, never mistake a lack of commotion for a sign that everything is all right; instead, keep your eyes on those you are supposed to be watching rather than trust that they will do or shout something to alert you if anything goes awry. Forget about trusting that old saw about drowners’ going down three times: they go down once, and they stay down.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dry-drowning/,"Disease, dry drowning"

See Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail and Twitter, October 2016To Silence Wikileaks, #HillaryClinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange -- report https://t.co/S7tPrl2QCZ— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016 UnprovenRATINGUnprovenORIGINOn 2 October 2016, the web site True Pundit published an article reporting that Hillary Clinton had supposedly attempted to order a drone strike on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in order to “silence” that organization’s efforts:“Can’t we just drone this guy?” Clinton openly inquired, offering a simple remedy to silence Assange and smother Wikileaks via a planned military drone strike, according to State Department sources. The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, “walking around” freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States … Immediately following the conclusion of the wild brainstorming session, one of Clinton’s top aides, State Department Director of Policy Planning Ann-Marie Slaughter, penned an email to Clinton, Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, and aides Huma Abebin and Jacob Sullivan at 10:29 a.m. entitled “an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re Wikileaks.”“Nonlegal strategies.” How did that phrasing make it into an official State Department email subject line dealing with solving Wikileaks and Assange? Why would the secretary of state and her inner circle be discussing any “nonlegal strategies” for anything whatsoever? Against anyone? Shouldn’t all the strategies discussed by the country’s top diplomat be strictly legal only? And is the email a smoking gun to confirm Clinton was actually serious about pursuing an obvious “nonlegal strategy” proposal to allegedly assassinate Assange? Numerous attempts were made to try and interview and decipher Slaughter’s choice of email wording, however, she could not be reached for comment. Insiders said Slaughter is keeping a “low profile” in Princeton, NJ until she is nominated for a position in Clinton’s cabinet if the Democrat is elected in November. Likewise, True Pundit attempted to contact Mills, Abedin, and Sullivan for their perspectives on this story. None commented on the record.The claim might not have seemed so incredible to some readers, as Assange himself had previously voiced the possibility of his being assassinated by drone, although even in his imaginings the chances of such an action (initiated by the CIA, not by Hillary Clinton) were not likely:WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fears he will be sent to the United States, where he could face the death penalty, and even worries that he will be targeted by a CIA drone.Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden on rape charges and has been holed up at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, said in an interview with The Times Magazine that things have become so dangerous that he cannot even poke his head out of the embassy’s balcony doors.“There are security issues with being on the balcony; there have been bomb threats and assassination threats from various people.”On the possibility of being “droned” by the CIA, Assange told the magazine: “I’m a white guy. Unless I convert to Islam, it’s not that likely that I’ll be droned, but we have seen things creeping toward that.”eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_2']));First of all, the only cited source documenting that Hillary Clinton had ever suggested (even in jest) that a drone strike could take out Julian Assange was “sources at the State Department,” a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification. Second, the claim that Hillary Clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of Assange in November 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms “legal and nonlegal strategies” that appeared in the subject line of e-mails sent by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State and released via WikiLeaks’ first searchable Hillary Clinton e-mail archive in March 2016.The e-mails in question purportedly followed Clinton’s proposing that Julian Assange be targeted by a drone strike:However, the text of those e-mails (located here and here) neither said nor implied anything of the sort:From: Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>Sent: Wednesday, November 24, 2010 5:36 AMTo: Slaughter, Anne-Marie; H Cc: Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J Subject:Re: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaksFollowing this morning’s meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff — Peter Harrell, Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy. AMAnne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Department of StateThe thrust of True Pundit’s article hinged almost entirely on claiming that the term “nonlegal” essentially means the same thing as “illegal,” and much of the article’s content delved into discussing why illegal methods for dealing with a WikiLeaks issue would be improper. However, “nonlegal” also bears a distinctly different meaning than “illegal”; the former can be used to distinguish discussions dealing with the law and legalities from discussions that don’t involve legal matters:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));Moreover, Anne-Marie Slaughter’s only reference to “nonlegal” methods were some “very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy” (included in an unavailable appended memo). Unless “public diplomacy” is reasonable code for “drone strike,” the most logical reading of the e-mail chain would be that the meeting referenced in the e-mail explored what legal actions could be taken to minimize damage from WikiLeaks, with a secondary focus on “nonlegal” (i.e., not related to law enforcement or litigation) approaches such as diplomacy and public relations.On 4 October 2016 Clinton answered a question about whether the rumor was accurate, responding that she didn’t “recall any joke … [reference to targeting Assange with a drone] would have been a joke”Hillary Clinton, eyes downcast, stammering: If I talked about droning Julian #Assange, ""it would have been a joke.""  pic.twitter.com/MnALounJo0— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 4, 2016",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/julian-assange-drone-strike/,"hillary clinton, julian assange, true pundit, wikileaks"

Here is the face of the evil swine. Please share repeatedly!! Flood facebook to show our respect for this TRASH.The uncited claim was somewhat unusual, as Malik had died in the hours after the shooting in which she took part. The deceased are occasionally represented by lawyers for matters pertaining to their estates, but it didn’t seem plausible any such legal representative would advocate for the redaction of images of her face in media reports presented after her death.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));A 4 December 2015 New York Times article identified two lawyers representing the Farook family (presumably on a number of issues related to the shooting). In that article, neither lawyer mentioned photographs of Malik’s face nor described the use of such images as “offensive” or “disrespectful to her and Islam.” However, a portion of that article might have inadvertently spawned the rumor:In a news conference, two lawyers for the Farook family said the couple’s family were shocked by the massacre. One of the lawyers, David Chesley, also questioned whether the Facebook post was actually by Ms. Malik.Mr. Chesley added that just before the massacre, Mr. Farook told his mother that he was taking Ms. Malik to the doctor and then left their 6-month-old daughter in her care. The mother has been interviewed by investigators for seven hours, the lawyer said. And the baby is with child protective services.A second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a “caring” and “soft-spoken” housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive. He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.By that account, Malik indeed typically kept her face covered for religious reasons. However, we were unable to locate any quoted material (either in the Times or elsewhere) in which either lawyer requested that Malik’s face not be shown in the media in deference to her religious devotion.A related iteration of the rumor attributed non-existent offense over the publication of images of Malik’s face to MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry. On 7 December 2015, the conspiracy-oriented web site InfoWars published an article that claimed:MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry was furious at the New York Times’ decision to publish a photograph of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik, fearing that the image could offend Muslims.Immediately underneath the assertion, the site embedded a video which did not include Harris-Perry making any such statement:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));In the clip, Harris-Perry interviewed Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab Association of New York, who expressed frustration at the inclusion of images of standard Islamic items (such as a Qu’ran) in the Times‘ coverage. Harris-Perry then pointed to an adjacent photograph of Malik and asserted that the paper had juxtaposed her picture with one of Islamic religious objects.However, Harris-Perry did not criticize the paper for publishing a photograph of Malik’s face, nor did she suggest, insinuate, hint, or claim that the use of the photograph constituted an offense to Islam by merit of the fact that Malik’s face was uncovered. The MSNBC host simply opined that the side-by-side images together created the impression that Islam was indistinguishable from terrorism. Harris-Perry’s specific comment clearly did not indicate that the sight of Malik’s uncovered face “could offend Muslims”:I mean that image [of Malik’s religious items], and then also right next to it an image of the shooting suspect there in hijab. And the idea of this is what terrorism looks like — for me that is a difference … this happens only for a specific community.While Tashfeen Malik was apparently in the habit of covering her face, it’s not true that lawyers representing her in death requested images of her face not be published.

It purports to be from Erin Brockovich ""Flint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don’t Pay For City’s Poison""						FalseRATINGFalseORIGINIn January 2016, an event primarily dubbed the “Flint water crisis” (involving lead contamination in the city’s water supply at levels that posed a serious health danger) garnered national headlines. Although some details were murky as the situation unfolded, a number of items related to the crisis were circulated worldwide via social media.The undisputed core of the public health crisis was summed up by the New York Times‘ report that “[h]igh levels of lead had leached from pipes into the water supply” in Flint in a period beginning around April 2014:Among the items related to the water crisis that circulated online was a piece from the Free Thought Project titled “Flint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don’t Pay for City’s Poison Water”:There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.However, the city’s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can’t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills … Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous.“Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,” [attorney Trachelle] Young added … Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government’s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));The article confusingly vacillated between assertions supported by a largely undisputed chain of events (i.e., the water supply in Flint had been compromised for some time, and its effect on families was severe) with alarming but unsubstantiated claims (i.e., CPS was threatening to remove children affected by the crisis). The headline clearly stated that residents of Flint had been threatened with the intervention of Michigan’s Children’s Protective Services (CPS) agency if they refused to pay for water that was clearly not potable, but we were unable to locate any other account reporting on what would be an extraordinary scenario.The Free Thought Project excerpt reproduced above was the sole source for this otherwise uncited claim. A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michigan’s Department of Health & Human Services’ (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglect allows the inference that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children.Page 15 of a publicly available document titled “Mandated Reporters’ Resource Guide” [PDF] further describes scenarios under which mandated reporters are obligated to contact CPS and file a report. Appendix 2, Section I (physical neglect), portion A pertains to neglect with respect to living conditions: under a list of items by which mandated reporters can observe potential conditions of neglect, “running water in the home” is listed as a potential signifier. As such, the above-excerpted item quite possibly extrapolated its conclusion based on the existence of the Flint water crisis and demonstrated standards of child abuse and neglect evidenced by Michigan’s documentation of those criteria.If so, the item made a significant leap between something that could conceivably happen (children’s being removed from homes due to a lack of running water under normal circumstances) and something that might be far less likely to happen (CPS’ tasking itself with imposing upon the crisis in the city of Flint by using its scant resources to target families and children already burdened by an ongoing and unprecedented contamination of Flint’s water supply). We were unable to find any other reporting of such claims aside from ones citing The Free Thought Project, nor could we locate any independent, anecdotal reports claiming that CPS was removing children from homes “without running water” in Flint.We contacted several divisions of MDHHS to determine whether there was any truth to the claim that CPS has removed children for reasons directly related to the Flint water crisis, or whether any such information or demands had been transmitted to families in Flint with respect to the water crisis.Under normal circumstances, the lack of running water in a home could certainly serve as grounds to initiate an investigation or even trigger removal of children from their home until basic living conditions are restored to the satisfaction of agencies tasked with ensuring children are safe from abusive or neglectful homes. Given widespread coverage of the Flint water crisis and its ongoing nature, the assertion doesn’t make much plausible sense (nor does it seem likely CPS could have the manpower to engage in such a large undertaking). The existence of such a crisis in Flint and its effect on the city’s residents are not in dispute and reasonably warrant alarm, but unsupported claims exacerbating concern and anxiety are not helpful to the residents of Flint or other people seeking credible information about the extent of an ongoing public health incident.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));In response to our inquiry, a representative from Michigan’s Department of Health & Human Services confirmed children are not removed from homes solely due to a lack of running water (due to the current situation in Flint, or otherwise):We do not petition a court for removal solely because of lack of water.Instead CPS works to make sure the children have water – by having them apply for State Emergency Relief, or making sure they have access to water at a relatives’ home or bottled water.On 26 January 2016, MDHHS Children’s Services Agency provided us with a statement from executive director Steve Yager. Yager’s statement confirmed no such complaints or removals occurred due to the Flint water crisis:MDHHS has not assigned a single Children’s Protective Services complaint due to any issues related to Flint water. MDHHS works proactively to assist families whose water is shut off and to ensure families have water filters and bottled water in Flint. When a family is without water, our goal is to help that family provide clean water for their children. That can be through assisting families in applying for State Emergency Relief, setting up plans for children to access safe water at a relative’s home or providing bottled water. We do not petition the court to remove a child solely for the lack of water in a family’s home.We also contacted the author of the original The Free Thought Project article for additional information supporting the claim. He directed us to the above-quoted MDHHS guidelines, as well as the article’s embedded RT video.

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who currently serves as Speaker of the House and will be chairing the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18–21, appeared on the Meet the Press public affairs program.  During that appearance, Speaker Ryan was questioned at length by interviewer Chuck Todd about the possibility of a “Dump Trump” movement among Republicans that would seek to deny the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump at the convention despite Trump’s having already secured enough delegates to guarantee a first-ballot win.Chuck Todd opened the segment of the program featuring Ryan with the following introduction:Good Sunday morning and happy Father’s Day to all fathers out there. Like a canceled TV show, back for summer reruns, the Dump Trump movement has sprung back to life. Why? Well, just look at what’s happened in the past week. Item one, in the wake of Orlando, Donald Trump’s self-congratulatory tweeting and suggestion that President Obama may be in league with ISIS were universally criticized.Item two, our NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll among other polls is showing a sharp trend towards Hillary Clinton with Clinton now leading Trump by seven points in our poll, 49, 42. Item three, right now, while Trump is raising money and campaigning in states that haven’t voted Democratic in at least a generation, Hillary Clinton is up on the air with a $23 million, two-week advertising blitz in eight swing states.“But don’t worry,” Donald Trump says, he hasn’t yet started the general election campaign. And item four, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whose interview with me you’ll see in just a moment — essentially is giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.Well, Trump reacted strongly to Ryan, and our follow-up conversation with him is coming up in a few minutes. But first, all of this is inspiring talk among jittery Republicans of yet another last-ditch effort to keep Trump from becoming the official nominee.Ryan’s response to Todd’s questioning might have been somewhat confusing to viewers following the current campaign drama.  Ryan had previously called Donald Trump a “racist” and denounced Trump’s rhetoric and proposals, yet he endorsed Trump and has so far declined to rescind that endorsement.  But at no time during that June 2016 Meet the Press interview did Ryan state that “I don’t care if Trump destroys the United States and that he is a liar and a fraud as long as we win in November” (the image shown above reflects someone else’s partisan summary of what he said), and Chuck Todd opened the program by declaring that Ryan was “essentially giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.”eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));But what Ryan repeatedly maintained during that interview was that it was not his place (as Speaker of the House or RNC chairman) to attempt to take the nomination away from a candidate who had secured it under the party’s existing rules and procedures; that he would opt (in Todd’s words) to “keep his party united [rather than] reject a presidential candidate whose values he does not share”:Well, first of all I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the first district of Wisconsin, but as Speaker of the House. And imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House, and strong majorities in Congress.The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House. I don’t want see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. Now having said that, you know me well, Chuck. If something is done and said that I don’t agree with that I think puts a bad label on conservatism, then I’m going to speak out on it as I have, as I will continue to do, and I hope I don’t have to keep doing.[Trump] won the election. The voters voted for him. That’s the point. He’s winning. He won the delegates. That’s the choice they made. This isn’t a top-down party where a handful of people pick our nominee, and the president. the voters picked him. That’s the choice they made. We — What can I control? That’s not something I can control.As Speaker of the House what I can control is, can I help add substance to this conversation? Can I bring ideas to the table? Can I lead the House Republicans to take our conservative principles, and apply them to the problems of the day to give people solutions that improve their lives, and try and inject some substance into this conversation, bring an agenda to the country?That’s what we’re doing.So here’s what I worry about, Chuck. I don’t worry everyday about what Donald Trump says and does. I worry about what I can do to help make this a better country, to help improve things, to help make this campaign one more about substance, and ideas. And that’s what we’re doing here as House Republicans. Go to “better-job-dot-GOP,” look at our Better Way Agenda that we’re rolling out. We’re trying to add some substance to this conversation, so that people know where we’re trying to go to get this country fixed.I’m Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. And that’s who I am. And that’s my responsibility.I’m not going to go into the hypotheticals. I have a responsibility. And that is to not try and disunify our party, and disrespect the voters — the Republican Primary Voters of America. And what I can control is can we add ideas. Can we add solutions? Can we bring substance to this conversation? The kind of election that I really want to have, that I wish we had in 2012, and prior years, is give the country a clear choice …My place is because of again this role I have, which I feel has very important responsibilities, is to call balls and strikes, and just play it by the rules. So it is not my job to tell delegates what to do, what not to do, or to weigh in on things like that. They write the rules. They make their decisions.All I want to make sure is that [the nomination is] done above board clearly, honestly, and by the rules. So I see my role now given that he’s got the plurality, he actually won, is pretty much a ceremonial position. But the last thing I’m going to do is weigh in, and tell delegates what to do — how to do their jobs.Some pundits have contended that Ryan will not disavow or roll back his support for Trump (no matter how much he might dislike or disagree with Trump) because he wants to see the Republicans take control of the government, but that’s a speculative interpretation of Ryan’s state of mind, not something Ryan has openly stated:The fact that House Speaker Paul Ryan will not rescind his support for a candidate he has called “racist” clashes badly with the image of Ryan the press has helped create. When Chuck Todd interviewed Ryan on Meet the Press, he sounded exasperated and puzzled in equal measure. Given Ryan’s denunciations of Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric and proposals, Todd pressed him, “How are you comfortable still supporting him?”Ryan’s rationale was practically tautological: “Imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress,” he said, despite growing evidence that Trump’s candidacy will make winning the White House and holding onto strong Republican majorities next to impossible even with Ryan in his corner.“You just made a case though of party over country,” Todd said. “No, I didn’t,” Ryan replied.For a man as close to achieving what no conservative in the history of the movement has achieved, Ryan’s crass expediency isn’t nearly as baffling as it seems. His plan for igniting a conservative revolution has always been fairly straightforward: First, Republicans have to win control of government, and then they can ignite a conservative revolution.Interested viewers can watch the entire Meet the Press program in question here:",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-ryan-confesses-national-tv/,"donald trump, paul ryan"

See Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail, June 2016							I saw a article that said ""Michigan loses right to farm"" meaning backyard farmers can't have chickens or any livestock for personal use. Is this true?						FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 20 June 2016 the web site Check Out the Healthy World published an article reporting that Michigan residents had lost the “right to farm … last week”:Michigan residents lost their “right to farm” this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes “effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.”Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan’s Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.“The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan — public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,” Gail Philbin told MLive.Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation.The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigan’s Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.A fundamental inaccuracy was apparent at the bottom of the page. Check Out the Healthy World cited the web site Inquisitr as a source, but in fact simply copied an article from that site in its entirety — an article that was originally published back in May 2014. So it was readily apparent that no such changes in the law or loss of farming rights occurred in June 2016.Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) maintains a web page hosting a link to the law in question, as well as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list. The latter [PDF] explains the Right to Farm Act [PDF], enacted in 1981, one purpose of which was to establish voluntary guidelines that farmers could follow in order to defend themselves against nuisance lawsuits filed by new residents moving into rural areas that had been subject to rapid housing development:The Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981. In the past century, people with limited understanding of farming were moving into rural areas. Typical farming conditions (dust, odors, etc.) and activities on nearby farms were unacceptable to new residents and sometimes nuisance suits were filed against the farmer. The Right to Farm Act was created in response to an increase in complaints and lawsuits. The Act calls for the creation of a set of Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices (GAAMPs) and provides an affirmative defense in nuisance lawsuits brought against the farmer by neighbors when the farmer is conforming to GAAMPs or when the farm existed prior to changes in land use in the areas surrounding the farm.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));That document also addressed changes made to that law in May 2014, around the time the original Inquisitr article (which held that the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development had acted to exclude small farming endeavors from laws originally allowing for such activities) appeared:In May 2014, the Commission approved the addition of a Category 4 for site selection within the GAAMPS. Category 4 sites, defined by the GAAMPs, are locations that are primarily residential and don’t allow agricultural uses by right. Under the Site Selection GAAMP, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] still will determine whether a site is primarily residential, which by definition are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or a non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility.We contacted MDARD for clarification on the scope of Michigan’s Right to Farm Act, as well as what aspects of it changed (or didn’t change) in May 2014. A representative for MDARD told us that misinformation was rife on social media with respect to those changes and the provisions of the act in general, and she pointed us to a 13 May 2014 press release separating fact from fiction:Changes over two years ago to the voluntary set of guidelines used to support the state’s Right to Farm Act have created a maelstrom of misunderstanding and misinformation about what the law does and does not do, including what protections it may or may not afford Michigan’s farming community. That misunderstanding continues to be amplified by social media reports which vastly misrepresent the facts and the potential impacts, especially as it relates to small and urban farmers.The release clarified that changes to the state’s Right to Farm Act is specific to commercial agriculture, not small family farmers raising food and animals for their own consumption, and the law’s original purpose was to provide protections for rural farmers due to an influx of previously urban dwellers unaccustomed to the ambiance of farm communities:Since the beginning, the Right to Farm Act has been specific to commercial agriculture, both small and large. Raising chickens or other food for your own family’s consumption has never been within the scope of the Right to Farm Act and that has not changed.The Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981 to address urban encroachment into rural areas because the folks moving into the country didn’t like the smells, sounds, dirt, etc. that come with agriculture and farming practices. The Act provides an affirmative defense to nuisance lawsuits if farmers are in conformance with the relevant Generally Accepted Agricultural Management Practice (GAAMP) standards.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));With respect to the May 2014 changes, MDARD emphasized that no law had ever allowed the keeping of livestock everywhere in Michigan. But since some non-rural, residential communities had passed regulations allowing residents to keep farm animals and others had not, the Right to Farm Act’s guidelines were modified to create a category of site that encompassed such non-farm areas:It’s important to remember that the Right to Farm Act has never provided blanket permission to locate farm animals in every corner of Michigan. The Livestock Site Selection GAAMP places conditions on the location of farm animals to reduce the risk of nuisance complaints. The difference over the past few years is that individuals are bringing farm animals into existing, primarily residential areas increasing the potential for conflict and nuisance complaints.The Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development made revisions to the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP adding Category 4 sites, which are locations that are primarily residential, don’t allow agricultural uses by right and are, therefore, not suitable for farm animals for purposes of the Right to Farm Act. Under the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP, primarily residential areas are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or one non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility. However, local communities can decide to allow farm animals under these circumstances.This decision was not made in haste. The Commission took hours of public testimony, held a number of meetings and has been looking into this issue for several years. In recent years, there has been increased interest in having a small number of livestock in non-rural areas. While more than 40 communities in Michigan have ordinances allowing for the keeping of livestock in non-rural residential areas, many do not, resulting in increased conflict between municipalities and livestock owners in these areas.In short, Michigan’s Right to Farm Act wasn’t drastically changed in June 2016 (or May 2014, for that matter), nor did it strip Michigan residents of their “right to farm” or to raise animals such as chickens and bees. Its voluntary standards were merely updated to recognize a new category of site: primarily residential, non-agricultural communities that are not suitable for farm animals.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/michigan-right-to-farm-act-repealed/,"homesteading, illegal sustainable living, michigan, right to farm, survivalism, urban farming"

He wrote about introducing his particular form of determined, but nonviolent protest, which he termed satyagraha, from the Sanskrit and Hindi term for “holding onto truth”:Unfortunately for His Excellency the movement is likely to grow with ridicule as it is certain to flourish on repression.[…]It is for the nation to return an effective answer by organised non-co-operation and change ridicule into respect. Ridicule is like repression. Both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect.[…]His Excellency resists the temptation to reply to his critics, meaning thereby that he has not changed his opinion on the many vital matters affecting the honour of India. He is ‘content to leave the issues to the verdict of history.’ Now this kind of language, in my opinion, is calculated further to inflame the Indian mind.[…]It will be admitted that non-co-operation has passed the stage ridicule. Whether it will now be met by repression or respect remains to be seen. Opinion has already been expressed in these columns that ridicule is an approved and civilized method of opposition. The viceregal ridicule though expressed in unnecessarily impolite terms was not open to exception.But the testing time has now arrived.

First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And that, is what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.Donald Trump is hardly the first person to attribute this homily to Gandhi, and in fact it’s a popular misattribution from politicians — several others, including Sarah Palin, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, recently made similar mistakes:Gandhi’s name has been associated with this quote since at least 1982, when the Workshop Of Nonviolence Institute summed up Gandhi’s philosophy in an issue of WIN Magazine:Gandhi once observed that every movement goes through four stages: First they ignore you; then they abuse you; then they crack down on you and then you win.The misattributed quote, then, is most likely a combination of Klein’s 1914 speech combined with an attempt to summarize Gandhi’s nonviolent doctrine and philosophy.",https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/first-they-ignore-you/,"donald trump, gandhi, quote"

Ended up bloody and covered in alcohol, so I’d say NOT all that shocking lmaooo https://t.co/qKOkjD9maE pic.twitter.com/RGsNmbkgg2— Blaire White (@MsBlaireWhite) November 12, 2017In the resulting roughly six-minute video, White claims she was assaulted twice, once at the anti-Trump rally and again when a pedestrian threw what appeared to be a drink in her face. Police told us White initiated an altercation at the rally by crossing a Los Angeles Police Department’s divider between pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters. Because she did not file a police report that night, it is unclear whether the incident with the drink was staged for the purpose of making a viral video (which was then featured by popular conservative web sites like Breitbart.com and InfoWars).eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));White and her boyfriend Joey Sarson started their Los Angeles adventure that day in West Hollywood, a city known for its high concentration of LGBT residents. After uneventfully walking the streets and even tipping a go-go dancer at The Abbey bar while wearing the conspicuous “Make America Great Again” cap, White concluded, “The gays are pretty polite.” So the duo took the act to the Walk of Fame, presciently noting:WHITE: Now we’re gonna go to Hollywood Boulevard, which if you guys don’t know, that is like the Walk of Fame here. That might be something different. It’s gonna be different.SARSON: Yeah. Yeah, it’s gonna be bad, yeah.WHITE: I’m scared. I’m wearing heels, I can’t fight. Just kidding, I can.As Sarson predicted, it was bad — probably because the pair conveniently wandered onto the Boulevard donning their Trump hats at a time when there was an anti-Trump protest underway, claiming they didn’t know the event was scheduled, but somehow possessing clairvoyant knowledge of a looming fight.In the video, which is heavily edited, the pair can be seen standing in front of a truck from which anti-Trump protest leaders were rallying the crowd with microphones. Although the video is blurry, it appears the two captured their attention. At one point, according to explainer text on the video, a protester snatches Sarson’s red cap and throws it. The video then cuts to White grappling with a protester for the hat before being separated by a Los Angeles police officer. She then points out that one of her acrylic fingernails had been ripped off and was bleeding.According to White’s video caption:Disclaimer: We never did anything remotely inflammatory or investigative to anyone. The point of this video was simply to wear a conservative symbol in a very liberal area.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));That is not exactly what happened, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Michael Ling. He told us the protest was permitted in the area of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue (in the heart of Hollywood) and that police had roped off a dividing line between pro-Trump and anti-Trump groups to keep them separated and to avoid violence. White and Sarson crossed into the anti-Trump crowd, which incited the physical contact seen in the video. Ling said police helped White get up and and away from the area, and that she declined to file a police report or press charges.Later in the video, White was giving a rundown of what happened at the protest when a man walked by her and threw some sort of liquid in her face, resulting in smeared makeup around her eyes and cheeks. She did not file a police report about that incident either. Ling said that detectives planned to follow up to see if she wishes to do so. Although it is unclear whether this aspect of the video was also staged, it would not be the first of its kind. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones had coffee thrown in his face three months earlier in an apparent on-camera stunt. White’s video was featured by Jones’ conspiracy site InfoWars.White is a YouTube star with a following of 360,000 fans, who has made a name for herself with sensational videos like “Crashing a Feminist March,” “Black Lives Matter Is Trash,” “Fat Acceptance Is Stupid,” and “There Are Only 2 Genders.” According to RationalWiki:Blaire White is a YouTube talker who frequently discusses transgender/LGBT/feminist issues from an antifeminist MRA and “anti-SJW” perspective. Because she’s also a trans woman, her views get extra respect — despite often holding views harmful to other trans people.
