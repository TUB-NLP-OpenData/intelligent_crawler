It was the first time he\u2019d ever gone swimming \u2014 and, tragically, it would be his last.\n[Rest of article here.]\n\nAlthough the account is essentially true, the article contains some confusing elements that could send parents scuttling to protect their children from one danger when they should be trying to guard them against a quite different one. \nA 10-year-old boy named Johnny (\u201cJon Jon\u201d) Jackson died as described above on 1 June 2008 in Goose Creek, South Carolina, subsequent to swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived. Although Johnny, a child who lived with autism and attention deficit disorder, was wearing flotation devices on his arms and was being monitored by his mother during his time in the pool, he did inhale some water while swimming; his mother described him as \u201ctaking a little bit of water in and coughing and then calming down.\u201d He afterwards appeared fine, but less than two hours after leaving the pool he twice defecated in his pants and complained of being tired. After being bathed and dressing himself back at the apartment, the boy walked to his bed unaided, leaving his mother to believe he was simply worn out. Yet when his mother checked on Johnny a few minutes later, she discovered that white foam was issuing from his mouth, his lips were blue, and his tongue was sticking out. The family called 911, but the Johnny suffered cardiac arrest during transport to the hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at Trident Medical Center.  According to the coroner, water was found in Johnny\u2019s lungs, and the cause of his death was listed as asphyxiation by drowning. \nWhile the article about Johnny\u2019s death is factual, it contains one key element of confusion: Jon Jon Jackson was not technically a \u201cdry drowning\u201d victim, but rather a victim of \u201cdelayed drowning,\u201d also termed \u201csecondary drowning.\u201d That distinction is important because numerous news articles that mentioned Johnny\u2019s death and attributed it to dry drowning also supplied the information that dry drowning is responsible for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths, thereby making it seem as though the tragic circumstances that swept away this one particular child loom as a huge risk to other children. This is not the case: The incidence of delayed drowning (which is what killed Johnny) is relatively uncommon; the incidence of true dry drowning is much greater. The latter is therefore what adult swimmers and the parents of juvenile swimmers need be more concerned about, but that form of drowning was not truly described in the article about Johnny\u2019s death.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany news stories, by the way, indicate they drew the \u201cten to fifteen percent\u201d figure from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC denies this, distancing itself from that particular factoid with this statement:\n\nUPDATE: Recent media reports have incorrectly attributed to CDC data about incidents of \u201cdry drowning.\u201d CDC supports international consensus defining drowning as \u201cthe process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid\u201d and does not distinguish between \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d drowning.\n\nThe primary difference between dry drowning and secondary (or delayed) drowning is the presence or absence of water in the victim\u2019s lungs. In Jon Jon Jackson\u2019s case, he died with water in his lungs, so his death was more typical of \u201cordinary\u201d drowning victims (i.e., water in the lungs prevented those organs from transporting oxygen into the bloodstream) even though he lived for a couple of hours after leaving the pool. By contrast, true dry drowning deaths do not involve the presence of liquid in the lungs.\nThere are two primary theories as to what causes dry drowning, and it may well be that both are correct and that this form of death can be brought on in two different ways. The first theory is that a sudden rush of water into the throat causes the airway to snap shut, a condition known as a laryngospasm. During this event, although no water enters the lungs, no air enters either, so the victim dies of asphyxiation. The second explanation posits that the shock of a swimmer\u2019s suddenly entering extremely cold water causes the heart to stop.\nDry drowning accounts for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths. Considering that approximately 4,000 people drown in the U.S. each year, that means dry drowning kills about 400 to 600 U.S. victims annually. It therefore poses a significant enough mortality risk that those who swim (or who supervise swimmers) should know what can be done to decrease the chance of its happening to them or their loved ones.\nTo help prevent dry drowning, keep your mouth closed when jumping or diving into water, thereby protecting the larynx from a sudden inrush of water that could cause it to spasm and cut off the airway. Also, do not dive or jump into extremely cold water; instead enter cold water gradually. Those who have a history of heart problems should avoid entering very cold water at all, even if they plan to go slowly.\nDrowning is the second most common cause of death in children in the United States. In addition to following the more usual cautions  (e.g., watch them like hawks all the time), caregivers of young swimmers should try to head off dry drowning by training their charges to keep their mouths closed when jumping into water and to enter very cold water slowly. Caregivers should also guard against delayed drowning by monitoring very closely any child who has come out of the water coughing and sputtering (signs of water having been breathed in), especially keeping an eye out for any further difficulties in breathing, extreme tiredness, or marked changes in behavior, all of which are signs that a swimmer may have inhaled a dangerous amount of fluid. Should such difficulties be noted in a swimmer, that person should be taken promptly to an emergency room for medical observation and, if necessary, intervention.\nOne additional caution should be noted regarding drowning: It is a fallacy that those who lose their lives in such fashion will flail about wildly even as they are slipping beneath the water\u2019s surface. Drowning generally occurs silently and smoothly, the victim quietly passing away wholly unnoticed as friends or family chatter nearby. Therefore, never mistake a lack of commotion for a sign that everything is all right; instead, keep your eyes on those you are supposed to be watching rather than trust that they will do or shout something to alert you if anything goes awry. Forget about trusting that old saw about drowners\u2019 going down three times: they go down once, and they stay down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnopes Staff\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n17 June 2008 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDisease\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdry drowning\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSources\n\t\t\n\n\nCelizic, Mike. \u00a0 \u201cBoy\u2019s Death Highlights a Hidden Danger: Dry Drowning.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 TodayShow.com. \u00a0 5 June 2008.\n\n\nChew, Kristina. \u00a0 \u201cBoy Dies During Nap, Possibly from Secondary Drowning.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Autism Vox. \u00a0 5 June 2008.\n\n\nParks, Nadine. \u00a0 \u201cBoy\u2019s Death Mystifies Mother.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The  [Charleston] Post and Courier. \u00a0 4 June 2008 \u00a0 (p.

Here is the face of the evil swine. Please share repeatedly!! Flood facebook to show our respect for this TRASH.\nThe uncited claim was somewhat unusual, as Malik had died in the hours after the shooting in which she took part. The deceased are occasionally represented by lawyers for matters pertaining to their estates, but it didn\u2019t seem plausible any such legal representative would advocate for the redaction of images of her face in\u00a0media reports presented after her death.\nA 4 December 2015 New York Times article identified\u00a0two lawyers representing the Farook family (presumably on a number of issues related to the shooting). In that article, neither lawyer mentioned photographs of Malik\u2019s face nor described the use of such images as \u201coffensive\u201d or \u201cdisrespectful to her and Islam.\u201d However, a portion of that article might have inadvertently spawned the rumor:\nIn a news conference, two lawyers for the Farook family said the couple\u2019s family were shocked by the massacre. One of the lawyers, David Chesley, also questioned whether the Facebook post was actually by Ms. Malik.\nMr. Chesley added that just before the massacre, Mr. Farook told his mother that he was taking Ms. Malik to the doctor and then left their 6-month-old daughter in her care. The mother has been interviewed by investigators for seven hours, the lawyer said. And the baby is with child protective services.\nA second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a \u201ccaring\u201d and \u201csoft-spoken\u201d housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive. He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that account, Malik indeed typically kept her face covered for religious reasons. However, we were unable to locate any quoted material (either in the\u00a0Times or elsewhere) in which either lawyer requested that Malik\u2019s face not be shown in the media in deference to her religious devotion.\nA related iteration of the rumor attributed non-existent offense over the publication of images of Malik\u2019s face to\u00a0MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry. On 7 December 2015, the conspiracy-oriented web site\u00a0InfoWars published an article that claimed:\nMSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry was furious at the New York Times\u2019 decision to publish a photograph of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik, fearing that the image could offend Muslims.\nImmediately underneath the assertion, the site embedded a video which did not include Harris-Perry making any such statement:\n\nIn the clip, Harris-Perry interviewed\u00a0Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab Association of New York, who expressed frustration at the inclusion of images of standard Islamic items (such as a Qu\u2019ran) in the\u00a0Times\u2018 coverage. Harris-Perry then pointed to an adjacent photograph of Malik and asserted that the paper had juxtaposed her picture with one of Islamic religious objects.\nHowever, Harris-Perry\u00a0did not criticize the paper for publishing a photograph of Malik\u2019s face, nor did she suggest, insinuate, hint, or claim that the\u00a0use of the photograph constituted an offense to Islam by merit of the fact that Malik\u2019s face was uncovered. The\u00a0MSNBC host simply opined that the side-by-side images together created the impression that Islam\u00a0was indistinguishable from\u00a0terrorism. Harris-Perry\u2019s specific comment clearly did not indicate that the sight of Malik\u2019s uncovered face \u201ccould offend Muslims\u201d:\nI mean that image\u00a0[of Malik\u2019s religious items], and then also right next to it an image of the shooting suspect there in hijab. And the idea of this is what terrorism looks like \u2014 for me that is a difference \u2026 this happens only for a specific community.\nWhile Tashfeen Malik was apparently in the habit of covering her face, it\u2019s not true that lawyers representing her in death requested images of her face not be published. Moreover, Melissa Harris-Perry was not \u201coutraged\u201d that the\u00a0New York Times \u201cinsulted Muslims\u201d by publishing a photograph of Malik\u2019s face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim LaCapria\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n9 December 2015 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmelissa harris-perry\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmuslims offended\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsan bernardino shooting\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors' Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Val Arkoosh condemned Pennsylvania House Bill 118 as \"unbelievable\" and \"outrageous\"...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWe talked to experts who have the answers.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tA viral image makes a range of claims about vaccine manufacturers to try to discourage...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere does HIPAA's privacy rule apply?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nContact Us\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchive\nShop\n\n\n\nSections\n\nLatest\nTop\nFact Checks\nNews\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nUse our RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDon't Sell My Info\nConsent Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Menu\n\n\n\n\nClose Main Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBecome a Member\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat's New\nFact Checks\nNews\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\nSearch Snopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "labels": [[50, 62, "extra_title"], [770, 785, "claimReview_datePublished"], [919, 1137, "claimReview_claimReviewed"], [1057, 1077, "extra_tags"], [6267, 6283, "extra_tags"], [6300, 6323, "extra_tags"], [33, 47, "extra_tags"]]}

The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, \u201cwalking around\u201d freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States \u2026 Immediately following the conclusion of the wild brainstorming session, one of Clinton\u2019s top aides, State Department Director of Policy Planning Ann-Marie Slaughter, penned an email to Clinton, Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, and aides Huma Abebin and Jacob Sullivan at 10:29 a.m. entitled \u201can SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re Wikileaks.\u201d\n\u201cNonlegal strategies.\u201d How did that phrasing make it into an official State Department email subject line dealing with solving Wikileaks and Assange? Why would the secretary of state and her inner circle be discussing any \u201cnonlegal strategies\u201d for anything whatsoever? Against anyone? Shouldn\u2019t all the strategies discussed by the country\u2019s top diplomat be strictly legal only? And is the email a smoking gun to confirm Clinton was actually serious about pursuing an obvious \u201cnonlegal strategy\u201d proposal to allegedly assassinate Assange? Numerous attempts were made to try and interview and decipher Slaughter\u2019s choice of email wording, however, she could not be reached for comment. Insiders said Slaughter is keeping a \u201clow profile\u201d in Princeton, NJ until she is nominated for a position in Clinton\u2019s cabinet if the Democrat is elected in November. Likewise, True Pundit attempted to contact Mills, Abedin, and Sullivan for their perspectives on this story. None commented on the record.\nThe claim might not have seemed so incredible to some readers, as Assange himself had previously voiced the possibility of his being assassinated by drone, although even in his imaginings the chances of such an action (initiated by the CIA, not by Hillary Clinton) were not likely:\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fears he will be sent to the United States, where he could face the death penalty, and even worries that he will be targeted by a CIA drone.\nAssange, who faces extradition to Sweden on rape charges and has been holed up at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, said in an interview with The Times Magazine that things have become so dangerous that he cannot even poke his head out of the embassy\u2019s balcony doors.\n\u201cThere are security issues with being on the balcony; there have been bomb threats and assassination threats from various people.\u201d\nOn the possibility of being \u201cdroned\u201d by the CIA, Assange told the magazine: \u201cI\u2019m a white guy. Unless I convert to Islam, it\u2019s not that likely that I\u2019ll be droned, but we have seen things creeping toward that.\u201d\nFirst of all, the only cited source documenting that Hillary Clinton had ever suggested (even in jest) that a drone strike could take out Julian Assange was \u201csources at the State Department,\u201d a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification. Second, the claim that Hillary Clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of Assange in November 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms \u201clegal and nonlegal strategies\u201d that appeared in the subject line of e-mails sent by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State and released via WikiLeaks\u2019 first searchable Hillary Clinton e-mail archive in March 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe e-mails in question purportedly followed Clinton\u2019s proposing that Julian Assange be targeted by a drone strike:\n\nHowever, the text of those e-mails (located here and here) neither said nor implied anything of the sort:\nFrom: Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\nSent: Wednesday, November 24, 2010 5:36 AM\nTo: Slaughter, Anne-Marie; H Cc: Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J Subject:\nRe: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks\nFollowing this morning\u2019s meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff \u2014 Peter Harrell, Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy. AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\nDirector of Policy Planning\nU.S. Department of State\nThe thrust of True Pundit\u2019s article hinged almost entirely on claiming that the term \u201cnonlegal\u201d essentially means the same thing as \u201cillegal,\u201d and much of the article\u2019s content delved into discussing why illegal methods for dealing with a WikiLeaks issue would be improper. However, \u201cnonlegal\u201d also bears a distinctly different meaning than \u201cillegal\u201d; the former can be used to distinguish discussions dealing with the law and legalities from discussions that don\u2019t involve legal matters:\n\nMoreover, Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2019s only reference to \u201cnonlegal\u201d methods were some \u201cvery good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy\u201d (included in an unavailable appended memo). Unless \u201cpublic diplomacy\u201d is reasonable code for \u201cdrone strike,\u201d the most logical reading of the e-mail chain would be that the meeting referenced in the e-mail explored what legal actions could be taken to minimize damage from WikiLeaks, with a secondary focus on \u201cnonlegal\u201d (i.e., not related to law enforcement or litigation) approaches such as diplomacy and public relations.\nOn 4 October 2016 Clinton answered a question about whether the rumor was accurate, responding that she didn\u2019t \u201crecall any joke\u00a0\u2026 [reference to targeting Assange with a drone]\u00a0would have been a joke\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, eyes downcast, stammering: If I talked about droning Julian #Assange, \"it would have been a joke.\"  pic.twitter.com/MnALounJo0\n\u2014

The celebrities varied, the locales varied (often there were multiple stories saying the same celebrity was called for jury duty in different places), but the wording of all the stories was basically the same:\nCOLUMBIA, Missouri \u2013 News reports out of Missouri are claiming that actor Johnny Depp has been selected for jury duty in Columbia, Missouri and will be required to attend a criminal trial in Columbia starting next month. The trial, which was not yet named, is scheduled to last roughly three weeks.\nDepp owns property in the Columbia area and, based on Missouri law, can be required to serve on a jury. Depp\u2019s publicist confirmed the news and stated that he was \u201chappy to fulfill his civic duty as a member of a jury in Columbia.\u201d\nSocial media was abuzz with the news that Johnny Depp would be spending a few weeks in Columbia with many of his fans more than a little excited about the prospect of seeing him in town.\nThe web addresses of the sites hosting the articles resembled those of actual news sites\u00a0\u2014 e.g, www.newsdaily10.com, channel18news.com, km8news.com, etc.\u00a0\u2014 but each featured the same disclaimer on its About Us\u00a0page admitting that the content was bogus:\nKM8 News\u00a0is a\u00a0fantasy news website. \u00a0Most articles on km8news.com are satire or pure fantasy.\nThe stories were reminiscent of a previous\u00a0round of hoaxes\u00a0in 2016 claiming celebrities were moving to various obscure small towns all across the United States to escape the rat race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Emery\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n29 July 2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchannel18news.com\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjohnny depp\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tjury duty\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors' Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Val Arkoosh condemned Pennsylvania House Bill 118 as \"unbelievable\" and \"outrageous\"...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWe talked to experts who have the answers.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tA viral image makes a range of claims about vaccine manufacturers to try to discourage...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere does HIPAA's privacy rule apply?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nContact Us\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchive\nShop\n\n\n\nSections\n\nLatest\nTop\nFact Checks\nNews\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nUse our RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 -

He\u00a0wrote about introducing his particular form of determined, but nonviolent protest, which he termed satyagraha, from the\u00a0Sanskrit and Hindi term for \u201cholding onto truth\u201d:\nUnfortunately for His Excellency the movement is likely to grow with ridicule as it is certain to flourish on repression.\n[\u2026]\nIt is for the nation to return an effective answer by organised non-co-operation and change ridicule into respect. Ridicule is like repression. Both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect.\n[\u2026]\nHis Excellency resists the temptation to reply to his critics, meaning thereby that he has not changed his opinion on the many vital matters affecting the honour of India. He is \u2018content to leave the issues to the verdict of history.\u2019 Now this kind of language, in my opinion, is calculated further to inflame the Indian mind.\n[\u2026]\nIt will be admitted that non-co-operation has passed the stage ridicule. Whether it will now be met by repression or respect remains to be seen. Opinion has already been expressed in these columns that ridicule is an approved and civilized method of opposition. The viceregal ridicule though expressed in unnecessarily impolite terms was not open to exception.\nBut the testing time has now arrived. In a civilized country when ridicule fails to kill a movement it begins to command respect.\nBut a\u00a0speech\u00a0by union leader Nicholas Klein in 1914 provides a closer version of the misattributed quote:\nAnd, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement.

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who currently serves as Speaker of the House and will be chairing the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18\u201321, appeared on the Meet the Press public affairs program.  During that appearance, Speaker Ryan was questioned at length by interviewer Chuck Todd about the possibility of a \u201cDump Trump\u201d movement among Republicans that would seek to deny the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump at the convention despite Trump\u2019s having already secured enough delegates to guarantee a first-ballot win.\nChuck Todd opened the segment of the program featuring Ryan with the following introduction:\nGood Sunday morning and happy Father\u2019s Day to all fathers out there. Like a canceled TV show, back for summer reruns, the Dump Trump movement has sprung back to life. Why? Well, just look at what\u2019s happened in the past week. Item one, in the wake of Orlando, Donald Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory tweeting and suggestion that President Obama may be in league with ISIS were universally criticized.\nItem two, our NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll among other polls is showing a sharp trend towards Hillary Clinton with Clinton now leading Trump by seven points in our poll, 49, 42. Item three, right now, while Trump is raising money and campaigning in states that haven\u2019t voted Democratic in at least a generation, Hillary Clinton is up on the air with a $23 million, two-week advertising blitz in eight swing states.\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d Donald Trump says, he hasn\u2019t yet started the general election campaign. And item four, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whose interview with me you\u2019ll see in just a moment \u2014 essentially is giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.\nWell, Trump reacted strongly to Ryan, and our follow-up conversation with him is coming up in a few minutes. But first, all of this is inspiring talk among jittery Republicans of yet another last-ditch effort to keep Trump from becoming the official nominee.\n\nRyan\u2019s response to Todd\u2019s questioning might have been somewhat confusing to viewers following the current campaign drama.  Ryan had previously called Donald Trump a \u201cracist\u201d and denounced Trump\u2019s rhetoric and proposals, yet he endorsed Trump and has so far declined to rescind that endorsement.  But at no time during that June 2016 Meet the Press interview did Ryan state that \u201cI don\u2019t care if Trump destroys the United States and that he is a liar and a fraud as long as we win in November\u201d (the image shown above reflects someone else\u2019s partisan summary of what he said), and Chuck Todd opened the program by declaring that Ryan was \u201cessentially giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.\u201d\nBut what Ryan repeatedly maintained during that interview was that it was not his place (as Speaker of the House or RNC chairman) to attempt to take the nomination away from a candidate who had secured it under the party\u2019s existing rules and procedures; that he would opt (in Todd\u2019s words) to \u201ckeep his party united [rather than] reject a presidential candidate whose values he does not share\u201d:\n\nWell, first of all I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the first district of Wisconsin, but as Speaker of the House. And imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House, and strong majorities in Congress.\nThe last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House. I don\u2019t want see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. Now having said that, you know me well, Chuck. If something is done and said that I don\u2019t agree with that I think puts a bad label on conservatism, then I\u2019m going to speak out on it as I have, as I will continue to do, and I hope I don\u2019t have to keep doing.\n[Trump] won the election. The voters voted for him. That\u2019s the point. He\u2019s winning. He won the delegates. That\u2019s the choice they made. This isn\u2019t a top-down party where a handful of people pick our nominee, and the president. the voters picked him. That\u2019s the choice they made. We \u2014 What can I control? That\u2019s not something I can control.\nAs Speaker of the House what I can control is, can I help add substance to this conversation? Can I bring ideas to the table? Can I lead the House Republicans to take our conservative principles, and apply them to the problems of the day to give people solutions that improve their lives, and try and inject some substance into this conversation, bring an agenda to the country?\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\nSo here\u2019s what I worry about, Chuck. I don\u2019t worry everyday about what Donald Trump says and does. I worry about what I can do to help make this a better country, to help improve things, to help make this campaign one more about substance, and ideas. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here as House Republicans. Go to \u201cbetter-job-dot-GOP,\u201d look at our Better Way Agenda that we\u2019re rolling out. We\u2019re trying to add some substance to this conversation, so that people know where we\u2019re trying to go to get this country fixed.\nI\u2019m Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. And that\u2019s who I am. And that\u2019s my responsibility.\nI\u2019m not going to go into the hypotheticals. I have a responsibility. And that is to not try and disunify our party, and disrespect the voters \u2014 the Republican Primary Voters of America. And what I can control is can we add ideas. Can we add solutions? Can we bring substance to this conversation? The kind of election that I really want to have, that I wish we had in 2012, and prior years, is give the country a clear choice \u2026\nMy place is because of again this role I have, which I feel has very important responsibilities, is to call balls and strikes, and just play it by the rules. So it is not my job to tell delegates what to do, what not to do, or to weigh in on things like that. They write the rules. They make their decisions.\nAll I want to make sure is that [the nomination is] done above board clearly, honestly, and by the rules. So I see my role now given that he\u2019s got the plurality, he actually won, is pretty much a ceremonial position. But the last thing I\u2019m going to do is weigh in, and tell delegates what to do \u2014 how to do their jobs.\n\nSome pundits have contended that Ryan will not disavow or roll back his support for Trump (no matter how much he might dislike or disagree with Trump) because he wants to see the Republicans take control of the government, but that\u2019s a speculative interpretation of Ryan\u2019s state of mind, not something Ryan has openly stated:\n\nThe fact that House Speaker Paul Ryan will not rescind his support for a candidate he has called \u201cracist\u201d clashes badly with the image of Ryan the press has helped create. When Chuck Todd interviewed Ryan on Meet the Press, he sounded exasperated and puzzled in equal measure. Given Ryan\u2019s denunciations of Donald Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric and proposals, Todd pressed him, \u201cHow are you comfortable still supporting him?\u201d\nRyan\u2019s rationale was practically tautological: \u201cImagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress,\u201d he said, despite growing evidence that Trump\u2019s candidacy will make winning the White House and holding onto strong Republican majorities next to impossible even with Ryan in his corner.\n\u201cYou just made a case though of party over country,\u201d Todd said. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Ryan replied.\nFor a man as close to achieving what no conservative in the history of the movement has achieved, Ryan\u2019s crass expediency isn\u2019t nearly as baffling as it seems. His plan for igniting a conservative revolution has always been fairly straightforward: First, Republicans have to win control of government, and then they can ignite a conservative revolution.\n\nInterested viewers can watch the entire Meet the Press program in question here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Mikkelson\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n21 June 2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdonald trump\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpaul ryan\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors' Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Val Arkoosh condemned Pennsylvania House Bill 118 as \"unbelievable\" and \"outrageous\"...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWe talked to experts who have the answers.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tA viral image makes a range of claims about vaccine manufacturers to try to discourage...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere does HIPAA's privacy rule apply?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nContact Us\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchive\nShop\n\n\n\nSections\n\nLatest\nTop\nFact Checks\nNews\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nUse our RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDon't Sell My Info\nConsent Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Menu\n\n\n\n\nClose Main Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBecome a Member\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat's New\nFact Checks\nNews\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\nSearch Snopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "labels": [[33, 66, "extra_title"], [852, 864, "claimReview_datePublished"], [998, 1121, "claimReview_claimReviewed"], [1728, 1740, "extra_tags"], [33, 42, "extra_tags"]]}

Although some details were murky as the situation unfolded, a number of items related to the crisis were circulated worldwide via social media.\nThe undisputed core of the public health crisis was summed up by the\u00a0New York Times\u2018 report that\u00a0\u201c[h]igh levels of lead had leached from pipes into the water supply\u201d in Flint in a period beginning around April 2014:\n\nAmong the items related to the water crisis that circulated online was a piece from\u00a0the Free Thought Project titled \u201cFlint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Don\u2019t Pay for City\u2019s Poison Water\u201d:\nThere is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.\nHowever, the city\u2019s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can\u2019t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills \u2026\u00a0Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous.\n\u201cEssentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,\u201d [attorney Trachelle] Young added\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government\u2019s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article confusingly vacillated between assertions supported by a largely undisputed chain of events (i.e., the water supply in Flint had been compromised for some time, and its effect on families was severe) with alarming but unsubstantiated claims (i.e., CPS was threatening to remove children affected by the crisis). The headline clearly stated that residents of Flint had been threatened with the intervention of Michigan\u2019s Children\u2019s\u00a0Protective Services (CPS) agency if they refused to pay for water that was clearly not potable, but we were unable to locate any other account reporting on what would be an extraordinary scenario.\nThe Free Thought Project excerpt reproduced above was the sole source for this otherwise uncited claim. A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michigan\u2019s Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglect\u00a0allows the inference\u00a0that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children.\nPage 15 of a publicly available document titled \u201cMandated\u00a0Reporters\u2019 Resource Guide\u201d [PDF] further describes scenarios under which mandated reporters are obligated to contact CPS and file a report. Appendix 2, Section I\u00a0(physical neglect), portion A pertains to neglect with respect to living conditions: under a list of items by which mandated reporters can observe potential conditions of neglect, \u201crunning water in the home\u201d is listed as a potential signifier. As such, the above-excerpted item quite possibly extrapolated its conclusion based on the existence of the Flint water crisis and demonstrated\u00a0standards of child abuse and neglect evidenced by Michigan\u2019s documentation of those criteria.\nIf so, the item made a significant leap between something that could conceivably happen (children\u2019s being removed from homes due to a lack of running water under normal circumstances) and something that might be far less likely to happen (CPS\u2019 tasking itself with imposing upon the crisis in the city of Flint by using its scant resources to target families and children already burdened by an ongoing and unprecedented contamination\u00a0of Flint\u2019s\u00a0water supply).\u00a0We were unable to find\u00a0any other reporting of such claims aside from ones citing\u00a0The Free Thought Project, nor could we locate any independent, anecdotal reports claiming that CPS was removing children from homes \u201cwithout running water\u201d in Flint.\nWe contacted several divisions of MDHHS to determine whether there was any truth to the claim that CPS has removed children for reasons directly related to the Flint water crisis, or whether any such information or demands had been transmitted to families in Flint with respect to the water crisis.\nUnder normal circumstances, the lack of running water in a home could certainly serve as grounds to initiate an investigation or even trigger removal of children from their home until basic living conditions are restored to the satisfaction of agencies tasked with ensuring children are safe from abusive or neglectful homes. Given widespread coverage of the Flint water crisis and its ongoing nature, the assertion doesn\u2019t make much plausible sense (nor does it seem likely CPS could have the manpower to engage in such a large undertaking). The existence of such a crisis in Flint and its effect on the city\u2019s residents are not in dispute and reasonably warrant alarm, but unsupported claims exacerbating concern and anxiety are not helpful to the residents of Flint or\u00a0other people seeking credible information about the extent of an ongoing public health incident.\nIn response to our inquiry, a representative from\u00a0Michigan\u2019s Department of Health & Human Services confirmed children are not removed from homes solely due to a lack of running water (due to the current situation in Flint, or otherwise):\nWe do not petition a court for removal solely because of lack of water.\nInstead CPS works to make sure the children have water \u2013 by having them apply for State Emergency Relief, or making sure they have access to water at a relatives\u2019 home or bottled water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 26 January 2016,\u00a0MDHHS Children\u2019s Services Agency provided us with a statement from executive director\u00a0Steve Yager. Yager\u2019s statement confirmed\u00a0no such complaints or removals occurred due to the Flint water crisis:\nMDHHS has not assigned a single Children\u2019s Protective Services complaint due to any issues related to Flint water. MDHHS works proactively to assist families whose water is shut off and to ensure families have water filters and bottled water in Flint. When a family is without water, our goal is to help that family provide clean water for their children. That can be through assisting families in applying for State Emergency Relief, setting up plans for children to access safe water at a relative\u2019s home or providing bottled water. We do not petition the court to remove a child solely for the lack of water in a family\u2019s home.\nWe also contacted\u00a0the author of the original\u00a0The Free Thought Project article for additional information supporting the claim. He directed us to the above-quoted MDHHS\u00a0guidelines, as well as\u00a0the article\u2019s embedded\u00a0RT\u00a0video. In that clip,\u00a0a Flint resident speculated\u00a0that refusal to pay water bills could result in the eventual removal of children due to a lack of running water in the home:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim LaCapria\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n26 January 2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tflint water crisis\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe free thought project\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors' Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Val Arkoosh condemned Pennsylvania House Bill 118 as \"unbelievable\" and \"outrageous\"...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWe talked to experts who have the answers.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tA viral image makes a range of claims about vaccine manufacturers to try to discourage...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere does HIPAA's privacy rule apply?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nContact Us\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchive\nShop\n\n\n\nSections\n\nLatest\nTop\nFact Checks\nNews\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nUse our RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 - 2021  by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDon't Sell My Info\nConsent Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Menu\n\n\n\n\nClose Main Menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBecome a Member\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat's New\nFact Checks\nNews\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\nSearch Snopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "labels": [[580, 682, "extra_title"], [1008, 1023, "claimReview_datePublished"], [1157, 1290, "claimReview_claimReviewed"], [874, 892, "extra_tags"], [2775, 2799, "extra_tags"]]}

Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes \u201ceffectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.\u201d\nBackyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan\u2019s Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.\n\u201cThe Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan \u2014 public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,\u201d Gail Philbin told MLive.\nMeanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation.\nThe Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michigan\u2019s Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.\nA fundamental inaccuracy was apparent at the bottom of the page. Check Out the Healthy World cited the web site Inquisitr as a source, but in fact simply copied an article from that site in its entirety \u2014 an article that was originally published back in May 2014. So it was readily apparent that no such changes in the law or loss of farming rights occurred in June 2016.\nMichigan\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) maintains a web page hosting a link to the law in question, as well as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list. The latter [PDF] explains the Right to Farm Act [PDF], enacted in 1981, one purpose of which was to establish voluntary guidelines that farmers could follow in order to defend themselves against nuisance lawsuits filed by new residents moving into rural areas that had been subject to rapid housing development:\nThe Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981. In the past century, people with limited understanding of farming were moving into rural areas. Typical farming conditions (dust, odors, etc.) and activities on nearby farms were unacceptable to new residents and sometimes nuisance suits were filed against the farmer. The Right to Farm Act was created in response to an increase in complaints and lawsuits. The Act calls for the creation of a set of Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices (GAAMPs) and provides an affirmative defense in nuisance lawsuits brought against the farmer by neighbors when the farmer is conforming to GAAMPs or when the farm existed prior to changes in land use in the areas surrounding the farm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat document also addressed changes made to that law in May 2014, around the time the original Inquisitr article (which held that the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development had acted to exclude small farming endeavors from laws originally allowing for such activities) appeared:\nIn May 2014, the Commission approved the addition of a Category 4 for site selection within the GAAMPS. Category 4 sites, defined by the GAAMPs, are locations that are primarily residential and don\u2019t allow agricultural uses by right. Under the Site Selection GAAMP, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] still will determine whether a site is primarily residential, which by definition are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or a non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility.\nWe contacted MDARD for clarification on the scope of Michigan\u2019s Right to Farm Act, as well as what aspects of it changed (or didn\u2019t change) in May 2014. A representative for MDARD told us that misinformation was rife on social media with respect to those changes and the provisions of the act in general, and she pointed us to a 13 May 2014 press release separating fact from fiction:\nChanges over two years ago to the voluntary set of guidelines used to support the state\u2019s Right to Farm Act have created a maelstrom of misunderstanding and misinformation about what the law does and does not do, including what protections it may or may not afford Michigan\u2019s farming community. That misunderstanding continues to be amplified by social media reports which vastly misrepresent the facts and the potential impacts, especially as it relates to small and urban farmers.\nThe release clarified that changes to the state\u2019s Right to Farm Act is specific to commercial agriculture, not small family farmers raising food and animals for their own consumption, and the law\u2019s original purpose was to provide protections for rural farmers due to an influx of previously urban dwellers unaccustomed to the ambiance of farm communities:\nSince the beginning, the Right to Farm Act has been specific to commercial agriculture, both small and large. Raising chickens or other food for your own family\u2019s consumption has never been within the scope of the Right to Farm Act and that has not changed.\nThe Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981 to address urban encroachment into rural areas because the folks moving into the country didn\u2019t like the smells, sounds, dirt, etc. that come with agriculture and farming practices. The Act provides an affirmative defense to nuisance lawsuits if farmers are in conformance with the relevant Generally Accepted Agricultural Management Practice (GAAMP) standards.\nWith respect to the May 2014 changes, MDARD emphasized that no law had ever allowed the keeping of livestock everywhere in Michigan. But since some non-rural, residential communities had passed regulations allowing residents to keep farm animals and others had not, the Right to Farm Act\u2019s guidelines were modified to create a category of site that encompassed such non-farm areas:\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the Right to Farm Act has never provided blanket permission to locate farm animals in every corner of Michigan. The Livestock Site Selection GAAMP places conditions on the location of farm animals to reduce the risk of nuisance complaints. The difference over the past few years is that individuals are bringing farm animals into existing, primarily residential areas increasing the potential for conflict and nuisance complaints.\nThe Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development made revisions to the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP adding Category 4 sites, which are locations that are primarily residential, don\u2019t allow agricultural uses by right and are, therefore, not suitable for farm animals for purposes of the Right to Farm Act. Under the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP, primarily residential areas are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or one non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility. However, local communities can decide to allow farm animals under these circumstances.\nThis decision was not made in haste. The Commission took hours of public testimony, held a number of meetings and has been looking into this issue for several years. In recent years, there has been increased interest in having a small number of livestock in non-rural areas. While more than 40 communities in Michigan have ordinances allowing for the keeping of livestock in non-rural residential areas, many do not, resulting in increased conflict between municipalities and livestock owners in these areas.\nIn short, Michigan\u2019s Right to Farm Act wasn\u2019t drastically changed in June 2016 (or May 2014, for that matter), nor did it strip Michigan residents of their \u201cright to farm\u201d or to raise animals such as chickens and bees. Its voluntary standards were merely updated to recognize a new category of site: primarily residential, non-agricultural communities that are not suitable for farm animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim LaCapria\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n31 May 2016 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\thomesteading\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tillegal sustainable living\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmichigan\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSources\n\t\t\n\n\nAdams, Jamie Clover. \u00a0 \u201cAgriculturally Speaking For May 13, 2014: Fact v.

Ended up bloody and covered in alcohol, so I\u2019d say NOT all that shocking lmaooo\u00a0https://t.co/qKOkjD9maE pic.twitter.com/RGsNmbkgg2\n\u2014 Blaire White (@MsBlaireWhite) November 12, 2017\n\nIn the resulting roughly six-minute\u00a0video, White claims she was assaulted twice, once at the anti-Trump rally and again when a pedestrian threw what appeared to be a drink in her face. Police told us White initiated an altercation at the rally by crossing a Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s divider between pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters. Because she did not file a police report that night, it is unclear whether the incident with the drink was staged for the purpose of making a viral video (which was then featured by popular conservative web sites like Breitbart.com and InfoWars).\nWhite and her boyfriend Joey Sarson started their Los Angeles\u00a0adventure\u00a0that day in West Hollywood, a city known for its high concentration of LGBT residents. After uneventfully walking the streets and even tipping a go-go dancer at The Abbey bar while wearing the conspicuous \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, White concluded, \u201cThe gays are pretty polite.\u201d So the duo took the act to the Walk of Fame, presciently noting:\nWHITE: Now we\u2019re gonna go to Hollywood Boulevard, which if you guys don\u2019t know, that is like the Walk of Fame here. That might be something different. It\u2019s gonna be different.\nSARSON: Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s gonna be bad, yeah.\nWHITE: I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m wearing heels, I can\u2019t fight. Just kidding, I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Sarson predicted, it was bad \u2014 probably because the pair conveniently wandered onto the Boulevard donning their Trump hats at a time when there was an anti-Trump protest underway, claiming they didn\u2019t know the event was scheduled, but somehow possessing clairvoyant knowledge of a looming fight.\nIn the video, which is heavily edited, the pair can be seen standing in front of a truck from which anti-Trump protest leaders were rallying the crowd with microphones. Although the video is blurry, it appears the two captured their attention. At one point, according to explainer text on the video, a protester snatches Sarson\u2019s red cap and throws it. The video then cuts to White grappling with a protester for the hat before being separated by a Los Angeles police officer. She then points out that one of her acrylic fingernails had been ripped off and was bleeding.\nAccording to White\u2019s video caption:\nDisclaimer: We never did anything remotely inflammatory or investigative to anyone. The point of this video was simply to wear a conservative symbol in a very liberal area.\nThat is not exactly what happened, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Michael Ling. He told us the protest was permitted in the area of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue (in the heart of Hollywood) and that police had roped off a dividing line between pro-Trump and anti-Trump groups to keep them separated and to avoid violence. White and Sarson crossed into the anti-Trump crowd, which incited the physical contact seen in the video. Ling said police helped White get up and and away from the area, and that she declined to file a police report or press charges.\nLater in the video, White was giving a rundown of what happened at the protest when a man walked by her and threw some sort of liquid in her face, resulting in smeared makeup around her eyes and cheeks. She did not file a police report about that incident either. Ling said that detectives planned to follow up to see if she wishes to do so. Although it is unclear whether this aspect of the video was also staged, it would not be the first of its kind. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones had coffee thrown in his face three months earlier in an apparent on-camera stunt. White\u2019s video was featured by Jones\u2019 conspiracy site\u00a0InfoWars.\nWhite is a YouTube star with a following of 360,000 fans, who has made a name for herself with sensational videos like \u201cCrashing a Feminist March,\u201d \u201cBlack Lives Matter Is Trash,\u201d \u201cFat Acceptance Is Stupid,\u201d and \u201cThere Are Only 2 Genders.\u201d According to RationalWiki:\nBlaire White is a YouTube talker who frequently discusses transgender/LGBT/feminist issues from an antifeminist MRA and \u201canti-SJW\u201d perspective. Because she\u2019s also a trans woman, her views get extra respect\u00a0\u2014 despite often holding views harmful to other trans people. Many of her videos feature sensationalized titles.\nThe video can be viewed in its entirety here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBethania Palma\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n14 November 2017 \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Jones\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tblaire white\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\thollywood\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSources\n\t\t\n\n\nCity News Service.\u00a0\u201cRefuse Fascism LA Group to Protest, March Against Trump in Hollywood.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a015 July 2017.\n\n\nWhite, Jamie.\u00a0\u201cTrans Activist Assaulted in Hollywood For Wearing MAGA Hat.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0InfoWars.com.\u00a013 November 2017.\n\n\nLuckhurst, Phoebe.\u00a0\u201cMilo Yiannopoulos to Tomi Lahren: the Faces of America\u2019s Young Alt-Right Pack.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0Evening Standard.\u00a08 December 2016.\n\n\nBell, Niko.\u00a0\u201cWhy Is a Trans Woman Leading a Men\u2019s Rights Group?.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0DailyXtra.com.\u00a021 January 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors' Picks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Val Arkoosh condemned Pennsylvania House Bill 118 as \"unbelievable\" and \"outrageous\"...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Pennsylvania Lawmakers Vote to Fine Women Who Have a Miscarriage?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWe talked to experts who have the answers.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tA viral image makes a range of claims about vaccine manufacturers to try to discourage...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat the \u2018Choosing Your COVID-19 Vaccine\u2019 Meme Gets Wrong\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere does HIPAA's privacy rule apply?\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnder HIPAA Rules, Can Businesses Ask If You Have Been Vaccinated Against COVID-19?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Fact Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat Is Critical Race Theory and Why Are Some People So Mad at It?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Musician Dr. Creep Predict the COVID Pandemic in a 2013 Song?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBackground Check: Investigating George Floyd\u2019s Criminal Record\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs This Photo of a Baby Albino Bat Real?\t\t\n\n\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Refuse To Give Interviews to White Journalists?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWere These Electric Cars Abandoned Because Their Batteries Failed?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid Michael Yeadon Say COVID-19 Vaccine Will Kill Recipients Within 2 Years?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes a New Facebook Algorithm Only Show You 26 Friends?\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout Us\nFAQ\nContact Us\nSubmit a Topic\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchive\nShop\n\n\n\nSections\n\nLatest\nTop\nFact Checks\nNews\n\n\n\nAccount\n\nLog In\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow Us on Twitter\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\nUse our RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1995 -
