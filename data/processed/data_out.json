Origin The following item was the text of an article titled \u201cBoy\u2019s death highlights a hidden danger: Dry drowning\u201d that was posted to the TodayShow.com site on 5 June 2008 and circulated widely online: The tragic death of a South Carolina 10-year-old more than an hour after he had gone swimming has focused a spotlight on the little-known phenomenon called \u201cdry drowning\u201d \u2013 and warning signs that every parent should be aware of. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a child could walk around, talk, speak and their lungs be filled with water,\u201d Cassandra Jackson told NBC News in a story broadcast Thursday on TODAY. On Sunday, Jackson had taken her son, Johnny, to a pool near their home in Goose Creek, S.C. It was the first time he\u2019d ever gone swimming \u2014 and, tragically, it would be his last. [Rest of article here .] Although the account is essentially true, the article contains some confusing elements that could send parents scuttling to protect their children from one danger when they should be trying to guard them against a quite different one. A 10-year-old boy named Johnny (\u201cJon Jon\u201d) Jackson died as described above on 1 June 2008 in Goose Creek, South Carolina, subsequent to swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived. Although Johnny, a child who lived with autism and attention deficit disorder, was wearing flotation devices on his arms and was being monitored by his mother during his time in the pool, he did inhale some water while swimming; his mother described him as \u201ctaking a little bit of water in and coughing and then calming down.\u201d He afterwards appeared fine, but less than two hours after leaving the pool he twice defecated in his pants and complained of being tired. After being bathed and dressing himself back at the apartment, the boy walked to his bed unaided, leaving his mother to believe he was simply worn out. Yet when his mother checked on Johnny a few minutes later, she discovered that white foam was issuing from his mouth, his lips were blue, and his tongue was sticking out. The family called 911, but the Johnny suffered cardiac arrest during transport to the hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at Trident Medical Center. According to the coroner, water was found in Johnny\u2019s lungs, and the cause of his death was listed as asphyxiation by drowning. While the article about Johnny\u2019s death is factual, it contains one key element of confusion: Jon Jon Jackson was not technically a \u201cdry drowning\u201d victim, but rather a victim of \u201cdelayed drowning,\u201d also termed \u201csecondary drowning.\u201d That distinction is important because numerous news articles that mentioned Johnny\u2019s death and attributed it to dry drowning also supplied the information that dry drowning is responsible for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths, thereby making it seem as though the tragic circumstances that swept away this one particular child loom as a huge risk to other children. This is not the case: The incidence of delayed drowning (which is what killed Johnny) is relatively uncommon; the incidence of true dry drowning is much greater. The latter is therefore what adult swimmers and the parents of juvenile swimmers need be more concerned about, but that form of drowning was not truly described in the article about Johnny\u2019s death. Many news stories, by the way, indicate they drew the \u201cten to fifteen percent\u201d figure from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC denies this, distancing itself from that particular factoid with this statement : UPDATE: Recent media reports have incorrectly attributed to CDC data about incidents of \u201cdry drowning.\u201d CDC supports international consensus defining drowning as \u201cthe process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid\u201d and does not distinguish between \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d drowning. The primary difference between dry drowning and secondary (or delayed) drowning is the presence or absence of water in the victim\u2019s lungs. In Jon Jon Jackson\u2019s case, he died with water in his lungs, so his death was more typical of \u201cordinary\u201d drowning victims (i.e., water in the lungs prevented those organs from transporting oxygen into the bloodstream) even though he lived for a couple of hours after leaving the pool. By contrast, true dry drowning deaths do not involve the presence of liquid in the lungs. There are two primary theories as to what causes dry drowning, and it may well be that both are correct and that this form of death can be brought on in two different ways. The first theory is that a sudden rush of water into the throat causes the airway to snap shut, a condition known as a laryngospasm. During this event, although no water enters the lungs, no air enters either, so the victim dies of asphyxiation. The second explanation posits that the shock of a swimmer\u2019s suddenly entering extremely cold water causes the heart to stop. Dry drowning accounts for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths. Considering that approximately 4,000 people drown in the U.S. each year, that means dry drowning kills about 400 to 600 U.S. victims annually. It therefore poses a significant enough mortality risk that those who swim (or who supervise swimmers) should know what can be done to decrease the chance of its happening to them or their loved ones. To help prevent dry drowning, keep your mouth closed when jumping or diving into water, thereby protecting the larynx from a sudden inrush of water that could cause it to spasm and cut off the airway. Also, do not dive or jump into extremely cold water; instead enter cold water gradually. Those who have a history of heart problems should avoid entering very cold water at all, even if they plan to go slowly. Drowning is the second most common cause of death in children in the United States. In addition to following the more usual cautions (e.g., watch them like hawks all the time), caregivers of young swimmers should try to head off dry drowning by training their charges to keep their mouths closed when jumping into water and to enter very cold water slowly. Caregivers should also guard against delayed drowning by monitoring very closely any child who has come out of the water coughing and sputtering (signs of water having been breathed in), especially keeping an eye out for any further difficulties in breathing, extreme tiredness, or marked changes in behavior, all of which are signs that a swimmer may have inhaled a dangerous amount of fluid. Should such difficulties be noted in a swimmer, that person should be taken promptly to an emergency room for medical observation and, if necessary, intervention. One additional caution should be noted regarding drowning: It is a fallacy that those who lose their lives in such fashion will flail about wildly even as they are slipping beneath the water\u2019s surface. Drowning generally occurs silently and smoothly, the victim quietly passing away wholly unnoticed as friends or family chatter nearby. Therefore, never mistake a lack of commotion for a sign that everything is all right; instead, keep your eyes on those you are supposed to be watching rather than trust that they will do or shout something to alert you if anything goes awry. Forget about trusting that old saw about drowners\u2019 going down three times: they go down once, and they stay down.

To Silence Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange? E-mail leaked by WikiLeaks doesn't demonstrate that Hillary Clinton suggested assassinating founder Julian Assange via a drone strike.

See Example(s) To Silence Wikileaks, #HillaryClinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange -- report https://t.co/S7tPrl2QCZ \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016 Collected via e-mail and Twitter, October 2016 Rating Unproven About this rating Do you rely on Snopes reporting? Become a member today. Origin On 2 October 2016, the web site True Pundit published an article reporting that Hillary Clinton had supposedly attempted to order a drone strike on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in order to \u201csilence\u201d that organization\u2019s efforts: \u201cCan\u2019t we just drone this guy?\u201d Clinton openly inquired, offering a simple remedy to silence Assange and smother Wikileaks via a planned military drone strike, according to State Department sources . The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, \u201cwalking around\u201d freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States \u2026 Immediately following the conclusion of the wild brainstorming session, one of Clinton\u2019s top aides, State Department Director of Policy Planning Ann-Marie Slaughter, penned an email to Clinton, Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, and aides Huma Abebin and Jacob Sullivan at 10:29 a.m. entitled \u201can SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re Wikileaks.\u201d \u201cNonlegal strategies.\u201d How did that phrasing make it into an official State Department email subject line dealing with solving Wikileaks and Assange? Why would the secretary of state and her inner circle be discussing any \u201cnonlegal strategies\u201d for anything whatsoever? Against anyone? Shouldn\u2019t all the strategies discussed by the country\u2019s top diplomat be strictly legal only? And is the email a smoking gun to confirm Clinton was actually serious about pursuing an obvious \u201cnonlegal strategy\u201d proposal to allegedly assassinate Assange? Numerous attempts were made to try and interview and decipher Slaughter\u2019s choice of email wording, however, she could not be reached for comment. Insiders said Slaughter is keeping a \u201clow profile\u201d in Princeton, NJ until she is nominated for a position in Clinton\u2019s cabinet if the Democrat is elected in November. Likewise, True Pundit attempted to contact Mills, Abedin, and Sullivan for their perspectives on this story. None commented on the record. The claim might not have seemed so incredible to some readers, as Assange himself had previously voiced the possibility of his being assassinated by drone, although even in his imaginings the chances of such an action (initiated by the CIA, not by Hillary Clinton) were not likely: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fears he will be sent to the United States, where he could face the death penalty, and even worries that he will be targeted by a CIA drone. Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden on rape charges and has been holed up at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, said in an interview with The Times Magazine that things have become so dangerous that he cannot even poke his head out of the embassy\u2019s balcony doors. \u201cThere are security issues with being on the balcony; there have been bomb threats and assassination threats from various people.\u201d On the possibility of being \u201cdroned\u201d by the CIA, Assange told the magazine: \u201cI\u2019m a white guy. Unless I convert to Islam, it\u2019s not that likely that I\u2019ll be droned, but we have seen things creeping toward that.\u201d First of all, the only cited source documenting that Hillary Clinton had ever suggested (even in jest) that a drone strike could take out Julian Assange was \u201csources at the State Department,\u201d a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification. Second, the claim that Hillary Clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of Assange in November 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms \u201clegal and nonlegal strategies\u201d that appeared in the subject line of e-mails sent by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State and released via WikiLeaks\u2019 first searchable Hillary Clinton e-mail archive in March 2016. The e-mails in question purportedly followed Clinton\u2019s proposing that Julian Assange be targeted by a drone strike: However, the text of those e-mails (located here and here ) neither said nor implied anything of the sort: From: Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov> Sent: Wednesday, November 24, 2010 5:36 AM To: Slaughter, Anne-Marie; H Cc: Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J Subject: Re: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaks Following this morning\u2019s meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff \u2014 Peter Harrell, Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy. AM Anne-Marie Slaughter Director of Policy Planning U.S. Department of State The thrust of True Pundit\u2019s article hinged almost entirely on claiming that the term \u201cnonlegal\u201d essentially means the same thing as \u201cillegal,\u201d and much of the article\u2019s content delved into discussing why illegal methods for dealing with a WikiLeaks issue would be improper. However, \u201c nonlegal \u201d also bears a distinctly different meaning than \u201cillegal\u201d; the former can be used to distinguish discussions dealing with the law and legalities from discussions that don\u2019t involve legal matters: Moreover, Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2019s only reference to \u201cnonlegal\u201d methods were some \u201cvery good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy\u201d (included in an unavailable appended memo). Unless \u201cpublic diplomacy\u201d is reasonable code for \u201cdrone strike,\u201d the most logical reading of the e-mail chain would be that the meeting referenced in the e-mail explored what legal actions could be taken to minimize damage from WikiLeaks, with a secondary focus on \u201cnonlegal\u201d (i.e., not related to law enforcement or litigation) approaches such as diplomacy and public relations. On 4 October 2016 Clinton answered a question about whether the rumor was accurate, responding that she didn\u2019t \u201crecall any joke \u2026 [reference to targeting Assange with a drone] would have been a joke\u201d Hillary Clinton, eyes downcast, stammering: If I talked about droning Julian #Assange , \"it would have been a joke.\" pic.twitter.com/MnALounJo0 \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 4, 2016 Published 3 October 2016 By Kim LaCapria Filed Under hillary clinton julian assange true pundit Sources Conway, Madeline. \u201cClinton: I Don\u2019t Recall Joking About Droning Julian Assange.\u201d Politico . 4 October 2016.
