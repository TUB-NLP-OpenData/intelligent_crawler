MixtureRATINGMixtureORIGINThe following item was the text of an article titled â€œBoyâ€™s death highlights a hidden danger: Dry drowningâ€ that was posted to the TodayShow.com site on 5 June 2008 and circulated widely online:The tragic death of a South Carolina 10-year-old more than an hour after he had gone swimming has focused a spotlight on the little-known phenomenon called â€œdry drowningâ€ â€“ and warning signs that every parent should be aware of.â€œIâ€™ve never known a child could walk around, talk, speak and their lungs be filled with water,â€ Cassandra Jackson told NBC News in a story broadcast Thursday on TODAY.On Sunday, Jackson had taken her son, Johnny, to a pool near their home in Goose Creek, S.C. It was the first time heâ€™d ever gone swimming â€” and, tragically, it would be his last.[Rest of article here.]Although the account is essentially true, the article contains some confusing elements that could send parents scuttling to protect their children from one danger when they should be trying to guard them against a quite different one. A 10-year-old boy named Johnny (â€œJon Jonâ€) Jackson died as described above on 1 June 2008 in Goose Creek, South Carolina, subsequent to swimming in the pool at the apartment complex where he lived. Although Johnny, a child who lived with autism and attention deficit disorder, was wearing flotation devices on his arms and was being monitored by his mother during his time in the pool, he did inhale some water while swimming; his mother described him as â€œtaking a little bit of water in and coughing and then calming down.â€ He afterwards appeared fine, but less than two hours after leaving the pool he twice defecated in his pants and complained of being tired. After being bathed and dressing himself back at the apartment, the boy walked to his bed unaided, leaving his mother to believe he was simply worn out. Yet when his mother checked on Johnny a few minutes later, she discovered that white foam was issuing from his mouth, his lips were blue, and his tongue was sticking out. The family called 911, but the Johnny suffered cardiac arrest during transport to the hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival at Trident Medical Center.  According to the coroner, water was found in Johnnyâ€™s lungs, and the cause of his death was listed as asphyxiation by drowning. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));While the article about Johnnyâ€™s death is factual, it contains one key element of confusion: Jon Jon Jackson was not technically a â€œdry drowningâ€ victim, but rather a victim of â€œdelayed drowning,â€ also termed â€œsecondary drowning.â€ That distinction is important because numerous news articles that mentioned Johnnyâ€™s death and attributed it to dry drowning also supplied the information that dry drowning is responsible for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths, thereby making it seem as though the tragic circumstances that swept away this one particular child loom as a huge risk to other children. This is not the case: The incidence of delayed drowning (which is what killed Johnny) is relatively uncommon; the incidence of true dry drowning is much greater. The latter is therefore what adult swimmers and the parents of juvenile swimmers need be more concerned about, but that form of drowning was not truly described in the article about Johnnyâ€™s death.   Many news stories, by the way, indicate they drew the â€œten to fifteen percentâ€ figure from the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC denies this, distancing itself from that particular factoid with this statement:UPDATE: Recent media reports have incorrectly attributed to CDC data about incidents of â€œdry drowning.â€ CDC supports international consensus defining drowning as â€œthe process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquidâ€ and does not distinguish between â€œwetâ€ and â€œdryâ€ drowning.The primary difference between dry drowning and secondary (or delayed) drowning is the presence or absence of water in the victimâ€™s lungs. In Jon Jon Jacksonâ€™s case, he died with water in his lungs, so his death was more typical of â€œordinaryâ€ drowning victims (i.e., water in the lungs prevented those organs from transporting oxygen into the bloodstream) even though he lived for a couple of hours after leaving the pool. By contrast, true dry drowning deaths do not involve the presence of liquid in the lungs.There are two primary theories as to what causes dry drowning, and it may well be that both are correct and that this form of death can be brought on in two different ways. The first theory is that a sudden rush of water into the throat causes the airway to snap shut, a condition known as a laryngospasm. During this event, although no water enters the lungs, no air enters either, so the victim dies of asphyxiation. The second explanation posits that the shock of a swimmerâ€™s suddenly entering extremely cold water causes the heart to stop.Dry drowning accounts for ten to fifteen percent of all drowning deaths. Considering that approximately 4,000 people drown in the U.S. each year, that means dry drowning kills about 400 to 600 U.S. victims annually. It therefore poses a significant enough mortality risk that those who swim (or who supervise swimmers) should know what can be done to decrease the chance of its happening to them or their loved ones.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));To help prevent dry drowning, keep your mouth closed when jumping or diving into water, thereby protecting the larynx from a sudden inrush of water that could cause it to spasm and cut off the airway. Also, do not dive or jump into extremely cold water; instead enter cold water gradually. Those who have a history of heart problems should avoid entering very cold water at all, even if they plan to go slowly.Drowning is the second most common cause of death in children in the United States. In addition to following the more usual cautions  (e.g., watch them like hawks all the time), caregivers of young swimmers should try to head off dry drowning by training their charges to keep their mouths closed when jumping into water and to enter very cold water slowly. Caregivers should also guard against delayed drowning by monitoring very closely any child who has come out of the water coughing and sputtering (signs of water having been breathed in), especially keeping an eye out for any further difficulties in breathing, extreme tiredness, or marked changes in behavior, all of which are signs that a swimmer may have inhaled a dangerous amount of fluid. Should such difficulties be noted in a swimmer, that person should be taken promptly to an emergency room for medical observation and, if necessary, intervention.One additional caution should be noted regarding drowning: It is a fallacy that those who lose their lives in such fashion will flail about wildly even as they are slipping beneath the waterâ€™s surface. Drowning generally occurs silently and smoothly, the victim quietly passing away wholly unnoticed as friends or family chatter nearby. Therefore, never mistake a lack of commotion for a sign that everything is all right; instead, keep your eyes on those you are supposed to be watching rather than trust that they will do or shout something to alert you if anything goes awry. Forget about trusting that old saw about drownersâ€™ going down three times: they go down once, and they stay down.",mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dry-drowning/,"Disease, dry drowning",snopes,us,,,,

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail and Twitter, October 2016To Silence Wikileaks, #HillaryClinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange -- report https://t.co/S7tPrl2QCZâ€” WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 3, 2016 UnprovenRATINGUnprovenORIGINOn 2 October 2016, the web site True Pundit published an article reporting that Hillary Clinton had supposedly attempted to order a drone strike on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in order to â€œsilenceâ€ that organizationâ€™s efforts:â€œCanâ€™t we just drone this guy?â€ Clinton openly inquired, offering a simple remedy to silence Assange and smother Wikileaks via a planned military drone strike, according to State Department sources. The statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, â€œwalking aroundâ€ freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States â€¦ Immediately following the conclusion of the wild brainstorming session, one of Clintonâ€™s top aides, State Department Director of Policy Planning Ann-Marie Slaughter, penned an email to Clinton, Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, and aides Huma Abebin and Jacob Sullivan at 10:29 a.m. entitled â€œan SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re Wikileaks.â€â€œNonlegal strategies.â€ How did that phrasing make it into an official State Department email subject line dealing with solving Wikileaks and Assange? Why would the secretary of state and her inner circle be discussing any â€œnonlegal strategiesâ€ for anything whatsoever? Against anyone? Shouldnâ€™t all the strategies discussed by the countryâ€™s top diplomat be strictly legal only? And is the email a smoking gun to confirm Clinton was actually serious about pursuing an obvious â€œnonlegal strategyâ€ proposal to allegedly assassinate Assange? Numerous attempts were made to try and interview and decipher Slaughterâ€™s choice of email wording, however, she could not be reached for comment. Insiders said Slaughter is keeping a â€œlow profileâ€ in Princeton, NJ until she is nominated for a position in Clintonâ€™s cabinet if the Democrat is elected in November. Likewise, True Pundit attempted to contact Mills, Abedin, and Sullivan for their perspectives on this story. None commented on the record.The claim might not have seemed so incredible to some readers, as Assange himself had previously voiced the possibility of his being assassinated by drone, although even in his imaginings the chances of such an action (initiated by the CIA, not by Hillary Clinton) were not likely:WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fears he will be sent to the United States, where he could face the death penalty, and even worries that he will be targeted by a CIA drone.Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden on rape charges and has been holed up at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, said in an interview with The Times Magazine that things have become so dangerous that he cannot even poke his head out of the embassyâ€™s balcony doors.â€œThere are security issues with being on the balcony; there have been bomb threats and assassination threats from various people.â€On the possibility of being â€œdronedâ€ by the CIA, Assange told the magazine: â€œIâ€™m a white guy. Unless I convert to Islam, itâ€™s not that likely that Iâ€™ll be droned, but we have seen things creeping toward that.â€eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_2']));First of all, the only cited source documenting that Hillary Clinton had ever suggested (even in jest) that a drone strike could take out Julian Assange was â€œsources at the State Department,â€ a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification. Second, the claim that Hillary Clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of Assange in November 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms â€œlegal and nonlegal strategiesâ€ that appeared in the subject line of e-mails sent by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State and released via WikiLeaksâ€™ first searchable Hillary Clinton e-mail archive in March 2016.The e-mails in question purportedly followed Clintonâ€™s proposing that Julian Assange be targeted by a drone strike:However, the text of those e-mails (located here and here) neither said nor implied anything of the sort:From: Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>Sent: Wednesday, November 24, 2010 5:36 AMTo: Slaughter, Anne-Marie; H Cc: Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob J Subject:Re: an SP memo on possible legal and nonlegal strategies re wikileaksFollowing this morningâ€™s meetings I activated my four legal eagles on the SP staff â€” Peter Harrell, Jen Harris, Bill Burke White, and Catherine Powell (that includes two law profs and two Yale law grads who certainly could be law profs). They in turn reached out to people at the Berkmann Center at Harvard and other experts, working together with Alec Ross. Alec has been particularly useful in terms not only of his knowledge but also his sensitivity to how anything we might try to do could impact our own internet freedom agenda. The result is the attached memo, which has one interesting legal approach and I think some very good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacy. AMAnne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Department of StateThe thrust of True Punditâ€™s article hinged almost entirely on claiming that the term â€œnonlegalâ€ essentially means the same thing as â€œillegal,â€ and much of the articleâ€™s content delved into discussing why illegal methods for dealing with a WikiLeaks issue would be improper. However, â€œnonlegalâ€ also bears a distinctly different meaning than â€œillegalâ€; the former can be used to distinguish discussions dealing with the law and legalities from discussions that donâ€™t involve legal matters:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));Moreover, Anne-Marie Slaughterâ€™s only reference to â€œnonlegalâ€ methods were some â€œvery good suggestions about how to handle our public diplomacyâ€ (included in an unavailable appended memo). Unless â€œpublic diplomacyâ€ is reasonable code for â€œdrone strike,â€ the most logical reading of the e-mail chain would be that the meeting referenced in the e-mail explored what legal actions could be taken to minimize damage from WikiLeaks, with a secondary focus on â€œnonlegalâ€ (i.e., not related to law enforcement or litigation) approaches such as diplomacy and public relations.On 4 October 2016 Clinton answered a question about whether the rumor was accurate, responding that she didnâ€™t â€œrecall any jokeÂ â€¦ [reference to targeting Assange with a drone]Â would have been a jokeâ€Hillary Clinton, eyes downcast, stammering: If I talked about droning Julian #Assange, ""it would have been a joke.""  pic.twitter.com/MnALounJo0â€” WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 4, 2016",unproven,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/julian-assange-drone-strike/,"hillary clinton, julian assange, true pundit, wikileaks",snopes,us,,,,

Here is the face of the evil swine. Please share repeatedly!! Flood facebook to show our respect for this TRASH.The uncited claim was somewhat unusual, as Malik had died in the hours after the shooting in which she took part. The deceased are occasionally represented by lawyers for matters pertaining to their estates, but it didnâ€™t seem plausible any such legal representative would advocate for the redaction of images of her face inÂ media reports presented after her death.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));A 4 December 2015 New York Times article identifiedÂ two lawyers representing the Farook family (presumably on a number of issues related to the shooting). In that article, neither lawyer mentioned photographs of Malikâ€™s face nor described the use of such images as â€œoffensiveâ€ or â€œdisrespectful to her and Islam.â€ However, a portion of that article might have inadvertently spawned the rumor:In a news conference, two lawyers for the Farook family said the coupleâ€™s family were shocked by the massacre. One of the lawyers, David Chesley, also questioned whether the Facebook post was actually by Ms. Malik.Mr. Chesley added that just before the massacre, Mr. Farook told his mother that he was taking Ms. Malik to the doctor and then left their 6-month-old daughter in her care. The mother has been interviewed by investigators for seven hours, the lawyer said. And the baby is with child protective services.A second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a â€œcaringâ€ and â€œsoft-spokenâ€ housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive. He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.By that account, Malik indeed typically kept her face covered for religious reasons. However, we were unable to locate any quoted material (either in theÂ Times or elsewhere) in which either lawyer requested that Malikâ€™s face not be shown in the media in deference to her religious devotion.A related iteration of the rumor attributed non-existent offense over the publication of images of Malikâ€™s face toÂ MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry. On 7 December 2015, the conspiracy-oriented web siteÂ InfoWars published an article that claimed:MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry was furious at the New York Timesâ€™ decision to publish a photograph of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik, fearing that the image could offend Muslims.Immediately underneath the assertion, the site embedded a video which did not include Harris-Perry making any such statement:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));In the clip, Harris-Perry interviewedÂ Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab Association of New York, who expressed frustration at the inclusion of images of standard Islamic items (such as a Quâ€™ran) in theÂ Timesâ€˜ coverage. Harris-Perry then pointed to an adjacent photograph of Malik and asserted that the paper had juxtaposed her picture with one of Islamic religious objects.However, Harris-PerryÂ did not criticize the paper for publishing a photograph of Malikâ€™s face, nor did she suggest, insinuate, hint, or claim that theÂ use of the photograph constituted an offense to Islam by merit of the fact that Malikâ€™s face was uncovered. TheÂ MSNBC host simply opined that the side-by-side images together created the impression that IslamÂ was indistinguishable fromÂ terrorism. Harris-Perryâ€™s specific comment clearly did not indicate that the sight of Malikâ€™s uncovered face â€œcould offend Muslimsâ€:I mean that imageÂ [of Malikâ€™s religious items], and then also right next to it an image of the shooting suspect there in hijab. And the idea of this is what terrorism looks like â€” for me that is a difference â€¦ this happens only for a specific community.While Tashfeen Malik was apparently in the habit of covering her face, itâ€™s not true that lawyers representing her in death requested images of her face not be published.

Although some details were murky as the situation unfolded, a number of items related to the crisis were circulated worldwide via social media.The undisputed core of the public health crisis was summed up by theÂ New York Timesâ€˜ report thatÂ â€œ[h]igh levels of lead had leached from pipes into the water supplyâ€ in Flint in a period beginning around April 2014:Among the items related to the water crisis that circulated online was a piece fromÂ the Free Thought Project titled â€œFlint Residents Told That Their Children Could Be Taken Away If They Donâ€™t Pay for Cityâ€™s Poison Waterâ€:There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.However, the cityâ€™s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they canâ€™t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment. Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills â€¦Â Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous.â€œEssentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,â€ [attorney Trachelle] Young addedÂ â€¦Â Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the governmentâ€™s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));The article confusingly vacillated between assertions supported by a largely undisputed chain of events (i.e., the water supply in Flint had been compromised for some time, and its effect on families was severe) with alarming but unsubstantiated claims (i.e., CPS was threatening to remove children affected by the crisis). The headline clearly stated that residents of Flint had been threatened with the intervention of Michiganâ€™s Childrenâ€™sÂ Protective Services (CPS) agency if they refused to pay for water that was clearly not potable, but we were unable to locate any other account reporting on what would be an extraordinary scenario.The Free Thought Project excerpt reproduced above was the sole source for this otherwise uncited claim. A careful reading of the text suggests that the site perhaps extrapolated two unrelated factual items to form a third hypothetical conclusion: It was true the Flint water crisis was unresolved at the time the article was published, and that Michiganâ€™s Department of Health & Human Servicesâ€™ (MDHHS) list of possible red flags for child abuse or neglectÂ allows the inferenceÂ that a lack of running water in a home is grounds for investigation and removal of children.Page 15 of a publicly available document titled â€œMandatedÂ Reportersâ€™ Resource Guideâ€ [PDF] further describes scenarios under which mandated reporters are obligated to contact CPS and file a report. Appendix 2, Section IÂ (physical neglect), portion A pertains to neglect with respect to living conditions: under a list of items by which mandated reporters can observe potential conditions of neglect, â€œrunning water in the homeâ€ is listed as a potential signifier. As such, the above-excerpted item quite possibly extrapolated its conclusion based on the existence of the Flint water crisis and demonstratedÂ standards of child abuse and neglect evidenced by Michiganâ€™s documentation of those criteria.If so, the item made a significant leap between something that could conceivably happen (childrenâ€™s being removed from homes due to a lack of running water under normal circumstances) and something that might be far less likely to happen (CPSâ€™ tasking itself with imposing upon the crisis in the city of Flint by using its scant resources to target families and children already burdened by an ongoing and unprecedented contaminationÂ of Flintâ€™sÂ water supply).Â We were unable to findÂ any other reporting of such claims aside from ones citingÂ The Free Thought Project, nor could we locate any independent, anecdotal reports claiming that CPS was removing children from homes â€œwithout running waterâ€ in Flint.We contacted several divisions of MDHHS to determine whether there was any truth to the claim that CPS has removed children for reasons directly related to the Flint water crisis, or whether any such information or demands had been transmitted to families in Flint with respect to the water crisis.Under normal circumstances, the lack of running water in a home could certainly serve as grounds to initiate an investigation or even trigger removal of children from their home until basic living conditions are restored to the satisfaction of agencies tasked with ensuring children are safe from abusive or neglectful homes. Given widespread coverage of the Flint water crisis and its ongoing nature, the assertion doesnâ€™t make much plausible sense (nor does it seem likely CPS could have the manpower to engage in such a large undertaking). The existence of such a crisis in Flint and its effect on the cityâ€™s residents are not in dispute and reasonably warrant alarm, but unsupported claims exacerbating concern and anxiety are not helpful to the residents of Flint orÂ other people seeking credible information about the extent of an ongoing public health incident.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));In response to our inquiry, a representative fromÂ Michiganâ€™s Department of Health & Human Services confirmed children are not removed from homes solely due to a lack of running water (due to the current situation in Flint, or otherwise):We do not petition a court for removal solely because of lack of water.Instead CPS works to make sure the children have water â€“ by having them apply for State Emergency Relief, or making sure they have access to water at a relativesâ€™ home or bottled water.On 26 January 2016,Â MDHHS Childrenâ€™s Services Agency provided us with a statement from executive directorÂ Steve Yager. Yagerâ€™s statement confirmedÂ no such complaints or removals occurred due to the Flint water crisis:MDHHS has not assigned a single Childrenâ€™s Protective Services complaint due to any issues related to Flint water. MDHHS works proactively to assist families whose water is shut off and to ensure families have water filters and bottled water in Flint. When a family is without water, our goal is to help that family provide clean water for their children. That can be through assisting families in applying for State Emergency Relief, setting up plans for children to access safe water at a relativeâ€™s home or providing bottled water. We do not petition the court to remove a child solely for the lack of water in a familyâ€™s home.We also contactedÂ the author of the originalÂ The Free Thought Project article for additional information supporting the claim. He directed us to the above-quoted MDHHSÂ guidelines, as well asÂ the articleâ€™s embeddedÂ RTÂ video. In that clip,Â a Flint resident speculatedÂ that refusal to pay water bills could result in the eventual removal of children due to a lack of running water in the home:Â ",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/flint-water-crisis-cps/,"flint water crisis, the free thought project",snopes,us,,,,

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via Facebook, June 2016FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 19 June 2016, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican who currently serves as Speaker of the House and will be chairing the Republican National Convention in Cleveland from July 18â€“21, appeared on the Meet the Press public affairs program.  During that appearance, Speaker Ryan was questioned at length by interviewer Chuck Todd about the possibility of a â€œDump Trumpâ€ movement among Republicans that would seek to deny the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump at the convention despite Trumpâ€™s having already secured enough delegates to guarantee a first-ballot win.Chuck Todd opened the segment of the program featuring Ryan with the following introduction:Good Sunday morning and happy Fatherâ€™s Day to all fathers out there. Like a canceled TV show, back for summer reruns, the Dump Trump movement has sprung back to life. Why? Well, just look at whatâ€™s happened in the past week. Item one, in the wake of Orlando, Donald Trumpâ€™s self-congratulatory tweeting and suggestion that President Obama may be in league with ISIS were universally criticized.Item two, our NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll among other polls is showing a sharp trend towards Hillary Clinton with Clinton now leading Trump by seven points in our poll, 49, 42. Item three, right now, while Trump is raising money and campaigning in states that havenâ€™t voted Democratic in at least a generation, Hillary Clinton is up on the air with a $23 million, two-week advertising blitz in eight swing states.â€œBut donâ€™t worry,â€ Donald Trump says, he hasnâ€™t yet started the general election campaign. And item four, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, whose interview with me youâ€™ll see in just a moment â€” essentially is giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.Well, Trump reacted strongly to Ryan, and our follow-up conversation with him is coming up in a few minutes. But first, all of this is inspiring talk among jittery Republicans of yet another last-ditch effort to keep Trump from becoming the official nominee.Ryanâ€™s response to Toddâ€™s questioning might have been somewhat confusing to viewers following the current campaign drama.  Ryan had previously called Donald Trump a â€œracistâ€ and denounced Trumpâ€™s rhetoric and proposals, yet he endorsed Trump and has so far declined to rescind that endorsement.  But at no time during that June 2016 Meet the Press interview did Ryan state that â€œI donâ€™t care if Trump destroys the United States and that he is a liar and a fraud as long as we win in Novemberâ€ (the image shown above reflects someone elseâ€™s partisan summary of what he said), and Chuck Todd opened the program by declaring that Ryan was â€œessentially giving fellow Republicans a permission slip to vote their conscience and run away from Trump if they have to.â€eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));But what Ryan repeatedly maintained during that interview was that it was not his place (as Speaker of the House or RNC chairman) to attempt to take the nomination away from a candidate who had secured it under the partyâ€™s existing rules and procedures; that he would opt (in Toddâ€™s words) to â€œkeep his party united [rather than] reject a presidential candidate whose values he does not shareâ€:Well, first of all I feel like I have certain responsibilities, as not just Congressman Paul Ryan from the first district of Wisconsin, but as Speaker of the House. And imagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House, and strong majorities in Congress.The last thing I want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House. I donâ€™t want see Hillary Clinton as president. I want to see a strong majority in the House and the Senate. And I think the way to achieve those goals is to have a more unified party, than a disunified party. Now having said that, you know me well, Chuck. If something is done and said that I donâ€™t agree with that I think puts a bad label on conservatism, then Iâ€™m going to speak out on it as I have, as I will continue to do, and I hope I donâ€™t have to keep doing.[Trump] won the election. The voters voted for him. Thatâ€™s the point. Heâ€™s winning. He won the delegates. Thatâ€™s the choice they made. This isnâ€™t a top-down party where a handful of people pick our nominee, and the president. the voters picked him. Thatâ€™s the choice they made. We â€” What can I control? Thatâ€™s not something I can control.As Speaker of the House what I can control is, can I help add substance to this conversation? Can I bring ideas to the table? Can I lead the House Republicans to take our conservative principles, and apply them to the problems of the day to give people solutions that improve their lives, and try and inject some substance into this conversation, bring an agenda to the country?Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing.So hereâ€™s what I worry about, Chuck. I donâ€™t worry everyday about what Donald Trump says and does. I worry about what I can do to help make this a better country, to help improve things, to help make this campaign one more about substance, and ideas. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing here as House Republicans. Go to â€œbetter-job-dot-GOP,â€ look at our Better Way Agenda that weâ€™re rolling out. Weâ€™re trying to add some substance to this conversation, so that people know where weâ€™re trying to go to get this country fixed.Iâ€™m Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. And thatâ€™s who I am. And thatâ€™s my responsibility.Iâ€™m not going to go into the hypotheticals. I have a responsibility. And that is to not try and disunify our party, and disrespect the voters â€” the Republican Primary Voters of America. And what I can control is can we add ideas. Can we add solutions? Can we bring substance to this conversation? The kind of election that I really want to have, that I wish we had in 2012, and prior years, is give the country a clear choice â€¦My place is because of again this role I have, which I feel has very important responsibilities, is to call balls and strikes, and just play it by the rules. So it is not my job to tell delegates what to do, what not to do, or to weigh in on things like that. They write the rules. They make their decisions.All I want to make sure is that [the nomination is] done above board clearly, honestly, and by the rules. So I see my role now given that heâ€™s got the plurality, he actually won, is pretty much a ceremonial position. But the last thing Iâ€™m going to do is weigh in, and tell delegates what to do â€” how to do their jobs.Some pundits have contended that Ryan will not disavow or roll back his support for Trump (no matter how much he might dislike or disagree with Trump) because he wants to see the Republicans take control of the government, but thatâ€™s a speculative interpretation of Ryanâ€™s state of mind, not something Ryan has openly stated:The fact that House Speaker Paul Ryan will not rescind his support for a candidate he has called â€œracistâ€ clashes badly with the image of Ryan the press has helped create. When Chuck Todd interviewed Ryan on Meet the Press, he sounded exasperated and puzzled in equal measure. Given Ryanâ€™s denunciations of Donald Trumpâ€™s racist rhetoric and proposals, Todd pressed him, â€œHow are you comfortable still supporting him?â€Ryanâ€™s rationale was practically tautological: â€œImagine the Speaker of the House not supporting the duly elected nominee of our party, therefore creating a chasm in our party to split us in half, which basically helps deny us the White House and strong majorities in Congress,â€ he said, despite growing evidence that Trumpâ€™s candidacy will make winning the White House and holding onto strong Republican majorities next to impossible even with Ryan in his corner.â€œYou just made a case though of party over country,â€ Todd said. â€œNo, I didnâ€™t,â€ Ryan replied.For a man as close to achieving what no conservative in the history of the movement has achieved, Ryanâ€™s crass expediency isnâ€™t nearly as baffling as it seems. His plan for igniting a conservative revolution has always been fairly straightforward: First, Republicans have to win control of government, and then they can ignite a conservative revolution.Interested viewers can watch the entire Meet the Press program in question here:",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-ryan-confesses-national-tv/,"donald trump, paul ryan",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 20 June 2016 the web site Check Out the Healthy World published an article reporting that Michigan residents had lost the â€œright to farm â€¦ last weekâ€:Michigan residents lost their â€œright to farmâ€ this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development. Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes â€œeffectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.â€Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michiganâ€™s Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.â€œThe Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan â€” public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,â€ Gail Philbin told MLive.Meanwhile, neighboring Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed Senate Bill 179 a few weeks before which freed up poultry and egg sales from local and state regulation.The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes. Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances. The Farm Bureau did not feel Michiganâ€™s Right To Farm Act was meant to protect the smaller farms, and ultimately the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed.A fundamental inaccuracy was apparent at the bottom of the page. Check Out the Healthy World cited the web site Inquisitr as a source, but in fact simply copied an article from that site in its entirety â€” an article that was originally published back in May 2014. So it was readily apparent that no such changes in the law or loss of farming rights occurred in June 2016.Michiganâ€™s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) maintains a web page hosting a link to the law in question, as well as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list. The latter [PDF] explains the Right to Farm Act [PDF], enacted in 1981, one purpose of which was to establish voluntary guidelines that farmers could follow in order to defend themselves against nuisance lawsuits filed by new residents moving into rural areas that had been subject to rapid housing development:The Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981. In the past century, people with limited understanding of farming were moving into rural areas. Typical farming conditions (dust, odors, etc.) and activities on nearby farms were unacceptable to new residents and sometimes nuisance suits were filed against the farmer. The Right to Farm Act was created in response to an increase in complaints and lawsuits. The Act calls for the creation of a set of Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices (GAAMPs) and provides an affirmative defense in nuisance lawsuits brought against the farmer by neighbors when the farmer is conforming to GAAMPs or when the farm existed prior to changes in land use in the areas surrounding the farm.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));That document also addressed changes made to that law in May 2014, around the time the original Inquisitr article (which held that the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development had acted to exclude small farming endeavors from laws originally allowing for such activities) appeared:In May 2014, the Commission approved the addition of a Category 4 for site selection within the GAAMPS. Category 4 sites, defined by the GAAMPs, are locations that are primarily residential and donâ€™t allow agricultural uses by right. Under the Site Selection GAAMP, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] still will determine whether a site is primarily residential, which by definition are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or a non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility.We contacted MDARD for clarification on the scope of Michiganâ€™s Right to Farm Act, as well as what aspects of it changed (or didnâ€™t change) in May 2014. A representative for MDARD told us that misinformation was rife on social media with respect to those changes and the provisions of the act in general, and she pointed us to a 13 May 2014 press release separating fact from fiction:Changes over two years ago to the voluntary set of guidelines used to support the stateâ€™s Right to Farm Act have created a maelstrom of misunderstanding and misinformation about what the law does and does not do, including what protections it may or may not afford Michiganâ€™s farming community. That misunderstanding continues to be amplified by social media reports which vastly misrepresent the facts and the potential impacts, especially as it relates to small and urban farmers.The release clarified that changes to the stateâ€™s Right to Farm Act is specific to commercial agriculture, not small family farmers raising food and animals for their own consumption, and the lawâ€™s original purpose was to provide protections for rural farmers due to an influx of previously urban dwellers unaccustomed to the ambiance of farm communities:Since the beginning, the Right to Farm Act has been specific to commercial agriculture, both small and large. Raising chickens or other food for your own familyâ€™s consumption has never been within the scope of the Right to Farm Act and that has not changed.The Right to Farm Act is a state law created in 1981 to address urban encroachment into rural areas because the folks moving into the country didnâ€™t like the smells, sounds, dirt, etc. that come with agriculture and farming practices. The Act provides an affirmative defense to nuisance lawsuits if farmers are in conformance with the relevant Generally Accepted Agricultural Management Practice (GAAMP) standards.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));With respect to the May 2014 changes, MDARD emphasized that no law had ever allowed the keeping of livestock everywhere in Michigan. But since some non-rural, residential communities had passed regulations allowing residents to keep farm animals and others had not, the Right to Farm Actâ€™s guidelines were modified to create a category of site that encompassed such non-farm areas:Itâ€™s important to remember that the Right to Farm Act has never provided blanket permission to locate farm animals in every corner of Michigan. The Livestock Site Selection GAAMP places conditions on the location of farm animals to reduce the risk of nuisance complaints. The difference over the past few years is that individuals are bringing farm animals into existing, primarily residential areas increasing the potential for conflict and nuisance complaints.The Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development made revisions to the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP adding Category 4 sites, which are locations that are primarily residential, donâ€™t allow agricultural uses by right and are, therefore, not suitable for farm animals for purposes of the Right to Farm Act. Under the Livestock Site Selection GAAMP, primarily residential areas are sites with more than 13 non-farm homes within an eighth of a mile of the livestock facility or one non-farm home within 250 feet of the livestock facility. However, local communities can decide to allow farm animals under these circumstances.This decision was not made in haste. The Commission took hours of public testimony, held a number of meetings and has been looking into this issue for several years. In recent years, there has been increased interest in having a small number of livestock in non-rural areas. While more than 40 communities in Michigan have ordinances allowing for the keeping of livestock in non-rural residential areas, many do not, resulting in increased conflict between municipalities and livestock owners in these areas.In short, Michiganâ€™s Right to Farm Act wasnâ€™t drastically changed in June 2016 (or May 2014, for that matter), nor did it strip Michigan residents of their â€œright to farmâ€ or to raise animals such as chickens and bees. Its voluntary standards were merely updated to recognize a new category of site: primarily residential, non-agricultural communities that are not suitable for farm animals.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/michigan-right-to-farm-act-repealed/,"homesteading, illegal sustainable living, michigan, right to farm, survivalism, urban farming",snopes,us,,,,

HeÂ wrote about introducing his particular form of determined, but nonviolent protest, which he termed satyagraha, from theÂ Sanskrit and Hindi term for â€œholding onto truthâ€:Unfortunately for His Excellency the movement is likely to grow with ridicule as it is certain to flourish on repression.[â€¦]It is for the nation to return an effective answer by organised non-co-operation and change ridicule into respect. Ridicule is like repression. Both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect.[â€¦]His Excellency resists the temptation to reply to his critics, meaning thereby that he has not changed his opinion on the many vital matters affecting the honour of India. He is â€˜content to leave the issues to the verdict of history.â€™ Now this kind of language, in my opinion, is calculated further to inflame the Indian mind.[â€¦]It will be admitted that non-co-operation has passed the stage ridicule. Whether it will now be met by repression or respect remains to be seen. Opinion has already been expressed in these columns that ridicule is an approved and civilized method of opposition.

was wearing a pro-Donald Trump hat.									MixtureRATINGMixtureWHAT'S TRUEYouTube star Blaire White did get into an altercation over her red ""Make America Great Again"" hat when she went to an anti-Trump protest on Hollywood Boulevard.WHAT'S FALSEPolice said White and her boyfriend initiated the altercation by crossing an LAPD dividing line meant to keep opposing sides separate to prevent violence.WHAT'S UNDETERMINEDLater in the video White has a drink thrown in her face; it's unclear if this was staged.ORIGINOn 11 November 2017, YouTube personalityÂ Blaire White descended upon a â€œRefuse Fascismâ€ anti-Donald Trump protest on Hollywood Boulevardâ€™s Walk of Fame with the pretense of performing a social experiment in which she wore a Trump hat whilst out and about in the supposed liberal mecca of Los Angeles (although the Walk of Fame is regularly packed with tourists from all over the world).NEW VIDEO: I wanted to see what would happen if I wore a Trump hat in public in Hollywood. Ended up bloody and covered in alcohol, so Iâ€™d say NOT all that shocking lmaoooÂ https://t.co/qKOkjD9maE pic.twitter.com/RGsNmbkgg2â€” Blaire White (@MsBlaireWhite) November 12, 2017In the resulting roughly six-minuteÂ video, White claims she was assaulted twice, once at the anti-Trump rally and again when a pedestrian threw what appeared to be a drink in her face. Police told us White initiated an altercation at the rally by crossing a Los Angeles Police Departmentâ€™s divider between pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters. Because she did not file a police report that night, it is unclear whether the incident with the drink was staged for the purpose of making a viral video (which was then featured by popular conservative web sites like Breitbart.com and InfoWars).eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));White and her boyfriend Joey Sarson started their Los AngelesÂ adventureÂ that day in West Hollywood, a city known for its high concentration of LGBT residents. After uneventfully walking the streets and even tipping a go-go dancer at The Abbey bar while wearing the conspicuous â€œMake America Great Againâ€ cap, White concluded, â€œThe gays are pretty polite.â€ So the duo took the act to the Walk of Fame, presciently noting:WHITE: Now weâ€™re gonna go to Hollywood Boulevard, which if you guys donâ€™t know, that is like the Walk of Fame here. That might be something different. Itâ€™s gonna be different.SARSON: Yeah. Yeah, itâ€™s gonna be bad, yeah.WHITE: Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m wearing heels, I canâ€™t fight. Just kidding, I can.As Sarson predicted, it was bad â€” probably because the pair conveniently wandered onto the Boulevard donning their Trump hats at a time when there was an anti-Trump protest underway, claiming they didnâ€™t know the event was scheduled, but somehow possessing clairvoyant knowledge of a looming fight.In the video, which is heavily edited, the pair can be seen standing in front of a truck from which anti-Trump protest leaders were rallying the crowd with microphones. Although the video is blurry, it appears the two captured their attention. At one point, according to explainer text on the video, a protester snatches Sarsonâ€™s red cap and throws it. The video then cuts to White grappling with a protester for the hat before being separated by a Los Angeles police officer. She then points out that one of her acrylic fingernails had been ripped off and was bleeding.According to Whiteâ€™s video caption:Disclaimer: We never did anything remotely inflammatory or investigative to anyone. The point of this video was simply to wear a conservative symbol in a very liberal area.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_5']));That is not exactly what happened, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Michael Ling. He told us the protest was permitted in the area of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue (in the heart of Hollywood) and that police had roped off a dividing line between pro-Trump and anti-Trump groups to keep them separated and to avoid violence. White and Sarson crossed into the anti-Trump crowd, which incited the physical contact seen in the video. Ling said police helped White get up and and away from the area, and that she declined to file a police report or press charges.Later in the video, White was giving a rundown of what happened at the protest when a man walked by her and threw some sort of liquid in her face, resulting in smeared makeup around her eyes and cheeks. She did not file a police report about that incident either. Ling said that detectives planned to follow up to see if she wishes to do so. Although it is unclear whether this aspect of the video was also staged, it would not be the first of its kind. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones had coffee thrown in his face three months earlier in an apparent on-camera stunt. Whiteâ€™s video was featured by Jonesâ€™ conspiracy siteÂ InfoWars.White is a YouTube star with a following of 360,000 fans, who has made a name for herself with sensational videos like â€œCrashing a Feminist March,â€ â€œBlack Lives Matter Is Trash,â€ â€œFat Acceptance Is Stupid,â€ and â€œThere Are Only 2 Genders.â€ According to RationalWiki:Blaire White is a YouTube talker who frequently discusses transgender/LGBT/feminist issues from an antifeminist MRA and â€œanti-SJWâ€ perspective. Because sheâ€™s also a trans woman, her views get extra respectÂ â€” despite often holding views harmful to other trans people. Many of her videos feature sensationalized titles.The video can be viewed in its entirety here:",mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/woman-attacked-on-camera-for-wearing-a-trump-hat-in-hollywood/,"Alex Jones, blaire white, hollywood, trump administration",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 16 August 2016 the Newslo web site reported that Indiana governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence had once called for a ban on condoms, maintainingÂ their useÂ â€œleads to abortionsâ€:The Patheos blog recently published an item titled â€œMike Pence: Condoms Are Too Modernâ€ reporting that the Indiana governor and Republican vice presidential nominee had dismissed the prophylactic devices as â€œtoo modern and too liberalâ€: â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s running mate is a dangerous Christian extremist who wants creationism taught in public schools and believes the government should pay for gay conversion therapy. In addition, in 2015, as Governor of Indiana, Pence allowed an HIV outbreak to spread, choosing prayer over a clean needle exchange. But perhaps one of the most idiotic claims made by Pence is that condoms are too â€œmodern,â€ too â€œliberal,â€ and offer a poor defense against sexually transmitted infections and diseases,â€ the item reads.Asking him to comment on his alleged statement, Pence was interviewed by The Huffington PostÂ â€¦Â Pence (then a Congressman) actually made in this regard stemmed from a February 2002 CNN panel discussion about abstinence education. Anchor Wolf Blitzer opened the segment by explaining a current controversy over remarks made by Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had just appeared on MTV and was asked about the Popeâ€™s stance on condom usage by Catholics. â€œYou know, the thing that got me riled up back then, and even does right now,â€ Pence recalled, â€œis the fact that Christian youth gets so easily accustomed to using condoms at a very young age. And you know, statistics show, even the manufacturers agree, that theyâ€™re just not 100% safe, theyâ€™re something like 97 or 98%. Thatâ€™s not what we want for our kids, is it?â€â€œI mean, at the end of the day, what condoms actually do is they give our kids a false sense of security, theyâ€™re actually tricking them into thinking theyâ€™re having safe sex, when in fact, very often, those intercourses result in unwanted teen pregnancies. And the reason why thatâ€™s happening is because condoms are designed to be hip, to be modern, to be practical and what not, and the truth is that thatâ€™s a lie. The only way to stay safe from premature pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases is to practice abstinence and pray to God, thatâ€™s the only real way to stay safe,â€ Pence argued. â€œAt the end of the day, itâ€™s the unjustified trust in condoms that plays a huge part in abortion rates going through the roofÂ â€¦Â If you want to risk ruining your life before itâ€™s even started, go ahead, gamble with condoms. But I say we need to ban them and make the right decision for those who clearly arenâ€™t capable of making it themselves. What we donâ€™t need are condoms that are unsafe; what we DO need are smarter kids, apparently,â€ he concluded.The item referenced a genuine controversy pertaining to remarks made by Pence about condoms back in 2002 during the course of a CNN panel discussion. But as with allÂ articles published byÂ Newslo (as well as sister sites sitesÂ Religionlo andÂ Politicalo), the piece featured aÂ fact-based introduction before introducing believable untruths. Like all articles on those threeÂ fake news sites, the Pence pieceÂ includedÂ a â€œshow factsâ€ or â€œhide factsâ€ buttonÂ (though all itemsÂ displayedÂ by default in â€œhide factsâ€ mode, obfuscating subsequent fabrications to new readers):eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_1']));Â All claimsÂ aside from those aboutÂ Penceâ€™s controversial 2002 remarks wereÂ embellishments typical ofÂ Newslo and its brethren.Â But readers unfamiliar with the siteâ€™s tendency to exaggerate topical subjects used Newsloâ€˜s fabricated quotes as a basis for political images, advancing the idea Pence genuinely said the things attributed to him by theÂ Newslo article (he did not).Newslo,Â Politicalo, and ReligionloÂ articles are almost alwaysÂ comprised ofÂ aÂ paragraph containing true information and a balance of embellishments about that grain of truth. Previously, those sites advanced claimsÂ ChrisÂ Christie saidÂ a female version of Viagra would lead to an uptickÂ â€œlesbianismâ€ and voted down a gender pay parity bill for Bible-based reasons, an Alabama politician proposedÂ saliva-basedÂ â€œhunger testsâ€ forÂ food stamp recipients, Ted Cruz saidÂ the death of Antonin Scalia was suspiciously timed, Pat Robertson assertedÂ David Bowie was still alive after his death, and thatÂ Mike Pence opined that if abortion was allowed in instances of rape that women would attempt to â€œget rapedâ€ in order to obtain an abortion.Â ",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mike-pence-condom-ban/,"abortion, condoms, mike pence, newslo",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 18 April 2017, third parties began making Facebook  Paul posts claiming that a pizza restaurant called Villaggioâ€™s in Massapequa, New York, refused to serve a soldier named John Welch because he tried to bringÂ a service dog in with him:Social media users posted items requesting that Long Islanders take action (presumably by boycotting, spreading the rumor, and leaving negative reviews for Villaggioâ€™s):This is my friend John Welch He was denied service at Villagioâ€™s [sic] Pizzeria, 3 Park Lane in Massapequa Park because he attempted to enter with his service dog â€œOnyxâ€.

Villaggioâ€™s did not refuse service to Mr. Welch, nor did they treat him differently than other customers because of his military status.   According to the principals involved, the issue was apparently one of a simple misunderstanding: Mr. Welch walked into the restaurant with a dog, the person who greeted him could not see the dogâ€™s service vest and so informed him that dogs were not allowed in the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Welch left without providing the restaurant the opportunity to accommodate him based upon the additional information that his dog was a service animal.Indeed, a Facebook user named John Welch posted the following on Facebook, stating that he was the man who had been turned away, and that the incidentÂ was based on a misunderstanding:Nonetheless, Villaggioâ€™s Yelp rating droppedÂ sharply due to a string of one-star reviews, all based solely upon Facebook posts about the rumor.We note for the sake of clarity that the term â€œservice animalâ€ (or â€œservice dogâ€) has a dual meaning.  One type of â€œservice animalâ€ is a dog that is â€œtrained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability,â€ such as a seeing-eye dog.  Another type of â€œservice animalâ€ is a dog that belongs to one of the U.S. armed services and performs military tasks such as sentry duty, tracking, or weapons detection.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires  businesses that serve the public (such as restaurants) to make â€œreasonable modificationsâ€ to their policies to accommodate people with disabilities, and rules about service animals (in the former sense) fall under this general principle.  As far as we know, there is no law requiring that businesses accommodate the second type of service animals (i.e., military dogs) referenced above.

The person who made the recording asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. That person gave the audio to Jennifer Harbury, a well-known civil rights attorney who has lived and worked for four decades in the Rio Grande Valley along the Texas border with Mexico. Harbury provided it to ProPublica. She said the person who recorded it was a client who â€œheard the childrenâ€™s weeping and crying, and was devastated by it.â€The person estimated that the children on the recording are between 4 and 10 years old. It appeared that they had been at the detention center for less than 24 hours, so their distress at having been separated from their parents was still raw.

Â The location in southern NevadaÂ will represent the semi-arid part of the planet of Jakku.Writer and director Rian Johnson is said to have personally chosen the location and will need the help of an extraordinarily large number of extras from Las Vegas and the surrounding area.

Obamacare.									FalseRATINGFalseeval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_page_title','ezslot_0']));ORIGINIn May 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the existence of a thirteen-man working group crafting a Senate bill aimed at repealing the Affordable Care Act (also called the ACA, but nicknamed Obamacare). Later, McConnell signaled that the Senate was no longer interested in modifying a bill that had already narrowly passed in the House of Representatives.That House version of the bill, named the American Health Care Act (AHCA), had been panned by critics (including by President Trump after initiallyÂ praising it), and current polling suggests that it does not enjoy a majority of support in a single USÂ state. In part because this House bill is so undeniably unpopular, the Senate has indicated that they will be ignoring the legwork done in the House and starting from scratch with this team of 13 senators. As discussed in a piece at Vox:The legislation is being written by 13 Republican senators â€” all of them men â€” in secret. No one has seen a draft of it. No public hearings have happened, and none are scheduled. Republicans briefly considered banning cameras from the halls of the Senate so they couldnâ€™t be asked about the bill on television. Various Senate Republicans have condemned the process.In response to the criticism this announcement generated, talking points emerged suggesting that passage of Obamacare has been just as opaque as GOP efforts to repeal it. While we allow that the legislative attempt to repeal the ACA is still ongoing, we reject this as a false equivalency, and argueÂ instead that the AHCA legislative process in both the House and the Senate (to date) far exceeds the ACA in terms of legislative secrecy based on any reasonable metric of transparency.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));Hearings and Public TestimonyAccording to Mark Peterson, chair of the UCLA Department of Public Policy, one easy metric by which to judge transparency is the number of hearings held during the development of a bill, as well as the different voices heard during those hearings. So far, the GOP repeal efforts have been subject to zero public hearings.In contrast, the ACA was debated in three House committees and two Senate committees, and subject to hours of bipartisan debate that allowed for the introduction of amendments. Peterson told us in anÂ e-mail that he â€œcanâ€™t recall any major piece of legislation that was completely devoid of public forums of any kind, and that were crafted outside of the normal committee and subcommittee structure to this extentâ€.Independent AssessmentAnother tool intended to promote transparency and open governance is an independent audit of the financial ramifications of a bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). While numerous bills eventually coalesced into what became the ACA, the CBO provided numerous reports on multiple aspects of the law ahead of its vote in the Senate.On 24 May 2017, the CBO released the results of an audit of the potentially abandoned AHCA House bill, concluding it â€œwould reduce federal deficits by $119 billion over the coming decade and increase the number of people who are uninsured by 23 million in 2026 relative to current lawâ€. While the Trump administration has questioned the report, it served to further reduce the billâ€™s popularity.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));In response, Senate republicans have indicated that they intend to move their bill to a vote rapidly, potentially before a CBO score would be ready, as reported by Axios:Republicans are sure to release the bill at some point, but itâ€™s unclear when â€” and they want to vote on it in the next three weeks, before the July 4 recess. [â€¦] When the bill is finished, itâ€™ll be sent to the Congressional Budget Office. Itâ€™ll take CBO about two weeks to evaluate and score a draft bill. Senate Republicans then want to vote on the bill before the July 4th recess. The draft bill had been expected to be finished tonight, but aides say the timing has slipped.Bipartisan DebateAnother metric one could use to look at legislative transparency is the extent to which the opposition party was included in the process. The ACA passed without a single Republican vote, but the contents of the bill were nonetheless made available to both parties multiple times throughout its development, as described by the New York Times:In June and July 2009, with Democrats in charge, the Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over 13 days marking up the bill that became the Affordable Care Act. That September and October, the Senate Finance Committee worked on the legislation for eight days â€” its longest markup in two decades. It considered more than 130 amendments and held 79 roll-call votes. The full Senate debated the health care bill for 25 straight days before passing it on Dec. 24, 2009.Senate Republicans, in the case of their efforts to repeal the ACA, have indicated that they do not intend to work with Democrats on the bill, and so far both the House bill and the new Senate effort lack input from the Democratic party. John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the Senate, flatly told the New York Times in March 2017 that â€œweâ€™re not going to do this with Democratsâ€. Other Republicans that are not part of the working group have been left out of the process as well.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content','ezslot_6']));While it remains to be seen whether or not McConnell will allow much time for debate or amendments on the final version of their bill, the procedural decisions they have made thus far suggest an effort to expedite the process. This bill will be introduced as a â€œreconciliation billâ€, which by law must be related to budgetary policy, and which comes with a series of advantages for bills that are politically controversial, as described by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:Created by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation allows for expedited consideration of certain tax, spending, and debt limit legislation.Â  In the Senate, reconciliation bills arenâ€™t subject to filibuster and the scope of amendments is limited, giving this process real advantages for enacting controversial budget and tax measures.Under this law, debate on the bill would be limited to 20 hours, and the focus of any amendment introduced by democrats would, by legal requirement, be limited in scope. Washington University political science professor Steven Smith,Â  an expert in congressional rules and procedures, told us that â€œthis effectively means that a major Democratic alternative would not be in order.â€â€œClosed Door Sessionsâ€Critics of the ACAâ€™s transparency point to closed door meetings with insurance industry representatives as evidence of its lack of transparency. These meetings did indeed happen, but according to Peterson there is â€œno comparisonâ€ between the two bills in terms of secrecy.UCLA School of Law professor Allison Hoffman told us she agrees with that assessment, noting that the process behind the Senate version of the bill has been so secretive as to preclude even having potentially shady backroom negotiations with industry representatives in the first place. â€œTheyâ€™re not even meeting with constituent groups at this point,â€ she told us via e-mail.As there is no metric we can think of that would put the AHCAâ€™s development, nascent as it may be, in a position to be more transparent than the ACA, we rank the claim of equal secrecy behind the ACA and AHCA as false. Instead we concur with the assessment provided by Julie Rovner, who Vox describes as â€œarguably the dean of the DC health care press corpsâ€:The extreme secrecy is a situation without precedent, at least in creating health care law.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he will be releasing a â€œdiscussion draftâ€ of the bill this Thursday.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/aca-versus-ahca/,"aca, affordable care act, ahca, obamacare, trump administration",snopes,us,,,,

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail and Twitter, March 2016 Mostly FalseRATINGMostly FalseWHAT'S TRUEChobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya proposed big businesses step in and assist with a refugee crisis; Chobani has hired 600 refugees.WHAT'S FALSEUlukaya did not vow to ""drown"" America in Muslim refugees; his proposal did not mention Muslims specifically; he has no legal ability to ""import Muslims"" at a rate of 300 per month.ORIGINOn 20 January 2016, CNN Money published an opinion item written by Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder of the Chobani brand of strained yogurt. Ulukayaâ€™s column posited that an ongoing refugee crisis could be ameliorated with the cooperation of businesses like his:What would happen if they summoned the spirit of innovation and ingenuity to solve the greatest humanitarian crisis of our lives? What if â€” to borrow a word from Silicon Valley â€” we could â€œhackâ€ the refugee crisis? Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking business leaders to do in Davos. As people of a free world, we have a moral obligation to the 60 million people who, like Nadia [a refugee from Kurdistan whose mother and brothers were massacred by ISIS], have been kidnapped or forced from their homes. People who need food, shelter, and opportunity, and have risked their lives to escape something that makes their childhood nightmares now seem like distant dreams. But itâ€™s not just people who can help. Businesses â€” and the hundreds of thousands of people they represent â€” have a major role to play. At Chobani, the food company I founded in the United States, we have hired hundreds of refugees in the past five years, and they are some of the most talented, dedicated people Iâ€™ve ever met.The column included a video segment during which Ulukaya discussed his proposition:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));On 20 January 2016, the unreliable web site WND.com responded to the op-ed with an editorial titled â€œAMERICAN YOGURT BILLIONAIRE: â€˜HIRE MORE MUSLIM REFUGEESâ€™; Calls on biggest U.S. companies to join Islamic surgeâ€ (even though the original column never mentioned Muslims):Ever wonder why the federal government would be sending hundreds of foreign refugees to a relatively small town in Idaho? Wonder no more. Theyâ€™re sent there, many of them, to work in the worldâ€™s largest yogurt factory. As WND previously reported, Twin Falls is in line to receive about 300 refugees this year, many of them Muslims from Syria. And the state of Idaho, despite its reputation as a mostly white, conservative farm state, has been a popular destination for refugees in recent years. The U.S. State Department has shipped more than 11,000 refugees directly from the Third World to Idaho since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Just in the past year, 989 refugees have arrived in the rural state, most of them landing in either Boise or Twin Falls. Nearly half have come from some of the worldâ€™s nastiest jihadist hot zones, including 95 from Iraq, 94 from Somalia, 47 from Sudan, 39 from Afghanistan, 31 from Iran, 28 from Syria and 11 from Pakistan, according to the federal refugee database. But despite growing protests by local residents against the refugee arrivals, the Twin Falls area can count on being a prime spot for refugees for years to come, thanks to one manâ€™s rising business enterprise â€¦ That man is Hamdi Ulukaya, a Kurdish Muslim and immigrant from Turkey who created the billion-dollar U.S.-based Chobani yogurt empire.WND collated a confusing number of metrics and purported statistics in their response to Ulukayaâ€™s article, stating that Twin Falls would receive 300 refugees in 2016 (but not all of them Muslim or involved with Chobani), that 11,000 refugees from â€œthe Third Worldâ€ had entered Idaho as a whole since September 2001, and that 989 refugees from unspecified nations had arrived in Boise or Twin Falls in â€œthe last year.â€ None of that mish-mash of numbers appeared directly related in any way to Chobaniâ€™s founder, or to his companyâ€™s hiring practices (especially given that the company wasnâ€™t even founded until four years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks).On 31 March 2016, the author of theÂ WNDÂ article contacted us with further information, substantiating that 961Â refugees from all nations (including Iraq, Iran, Burma, Russia, and Ukraine) entered Idaho in the calendar year 2015. Breakdowns of the that information by state can be found here:eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));What was particularly notable within the Department of Stateâ€™s refugee records for calendar year 2015Â wereÂ demographicsÂ of peopleÂ seeking asylum. While rumors claimed that refugees were primarily from Muslim countries (most typically Syria), the vast majority of people asking forÂ asylum in Idaho were not from Muslim countries: In 2015 a scant 28 Syrians (fewer than two percent of Idahoâ€™s total) sought asylum in Idaho, despite intense focus on Syriaâ€™s refugees in the media. By contrast, 611Â of the 961 refugees came from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Burundi, and the Central African Republic (64 percent of all people settled in Idaho in 2015). Christianity (not Islam) was the primary religion in all but Somalia. Another 137 (14 percent) came from Burma (98) and Bhutan (39), countries that are primarily Buddhist.Â Removing the 9.7Â percent from Somalia, the sum total of refugees from primarily Christian or Buddhist countries alone settling in Idaho in 2015 was 654 (or nearly 70 percent). Another two percent came from non-Muslim countries like Colombia, Russia, and Ukraine; despite the title of the piece, more than two-thirds of the refugees logged in the source material did not come from primarily Muslim countries.Not long after the WND item appeared in January 2016, Facebook users began sharing the above-reproduced image macro reading:Boycott Chobani Yogurt, an American based yogurt manufacturing company in Idaho that is owned by a muslim who says he is going to drown the United States in Muslims and is importing them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory. He is also giving them the jobs that should go to American families even though his American neighbors have protested his actions and oppose his behavior. Please do not buy Chobani Yogurt!eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content','ezslot_6']));As with many rumors of its type, the Chobani rumor evolved to encompass multiple versions inaccurately describingÂ Ulukayaâ€™s proposition, intent, and practices, including completely fabricated claims that Ulukaya had vowed to â€œfloodâ€ the U.S. with Muslims or â€œdrownâ€ the country in refugees. Some versions of the rumor asserted the CEO â€œimportedâ€ 300 Muslims per monthâ€ to the U.S. specifically to work in his Idaho plant, a claim which was difficult to square with immigration math. Per the U.S. Department of State, roughly 21,000 work visas were grantedÂ nationwide in each of fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 [PDF]. If the claims about â€œ300 Muslims per monthâ€ were to be believed 17% ofÂ all work visas were going to persons employed by a single yogurt plant in Idaho, irrespective of the fact that business people donâ€™t have the authority to grant work visas of any description in the first place.WND appeared to have extrapolated some of their numbers from a 15 January 2016Â Financial Times profile of Ulukaya and his efforts to help refugees, which noted that the entire Chobani global workforce was made up ofÂ only 600 refugees (of all nationalities and religions):Ulukaya decided to act. Last year he established a foundation, Tent, to channel financial aid and innovation efforts into refugee work. He also declared that he would give half his fortune to refugee causes (he has made an eye-popping $1.4bn from his wildly popular Chobani yoghurts in recent years). And he has stepped up efforts to hire as many refugees as he can at his yoghurt plants, where they currently account for 30 per cent of the total workforce, or 600 people. â€œThere are 11 or 12 languages spoken in our factories,â€ says Ulukaya. â€œWe have translators 24 hours a day.â€However, initial reporting upon the Idaho yogurt-processing plants facilityâ€™s opening in 2012 indicated that the plant employed 300 people in total, further calling into question claims that Chobani was placing 300 Muslim refugees per month in that same Idaho plant. Either Chobani was experiencing credulity-testing and unchecked monthly expansion, or the numbers were way off:Chobani, the yogurt company that grew from nothing five years ago to a roughly $1 billion powerhouse today, will formally open one of the worldâ€™s largest yogurt-processing plants in Twin Falls, Idaho. The $450 million, 1 million square-foot plant is the companyâ€™s second. It will employ 300 people, and Mr. Ulukaya said for every 10 jobs it creates directly, it is expected to create roughly 66 additional jobs in ancillary businesses.The claim that Chobani was headquartered in Idaho was also inaccurate. While the brand operates processing facilities in that state, Chobani was founded, and remains headquartered in,Â New York.It is true that Ulukaya proposed using business employment as a novel approach to a refugee crisis in January 2016. However, claims that he sought to assist only Muslim refugees and was personally â€œimportingâ€ 300 Muslims per month to work in his Idaho plant were fabrications.",mostly false,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chobani-ceo-importing-300-muslim-refugees-per-month/,"refugees, WND, world net daily",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 19 May 1988, the scientific journal Nature published a brief report by two psychologists titled â€œDo right-handers live longer?â€ ItÂ purported to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in longevity between right and left handers, based on data collected on professional baseball players:To investigate further the relationship between handedness and age of death, we have analysed all baseball players listed in The Baseball Encyclopedia for whom dates of birth and death, as well as throwing and batting hand, are reported. A subject was assigned to a handedness a group only when both throwing and batting hand were the same with no indicated I change in hand use. Mean age at death for the 1,472 right-handers was 64.64 years (s.d. = 15.5) and ( 236 left-handers was 63.97 years (s.d. = 15.4).These same authors published another studyÂ (â€œHandedness and Life Spanâ€) in the equally prestigious New England Journal of Medicine by sampling the death records for the year 1990 in two California counties, which demonstrated â€” they argued â€” an even larger difference in lifespan between left and right handers:In order to test the relation between handedness and life span in a general population, we obtained death certificates from two counties in southern California. Two thousand questionnaires concerning the handedness of the deceased family member were sent to the listed next of kin, which resulted in 987 usable cases (495 male subjects and 492 female subjects). Subjects were designated as right-handers if they wrote, drew, and threw a ball with the right hand. All other subjects (left-handers and mixed-handers) were assigned to a non-right-handed group.When we turn to the effect of handedness on life span, the results are striking in their magnitude. The mean age at death in the right-handed sample was 75 years, as compared with the life-span for the left-handers is significant (Fl,945 = 22.36, P<0.0001).eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_5']));Critics of these studies have noted that their methodologies are flawed, as they assume an staticÂ proportion of left and right handed people throughout time â€” despite the fact that many people who were born in early 1900s were likely pressured to become right-handed at an early age, and would not identify as left-handed at death. Historical records support this argument, presented in the book Language Lateralization and Psychosis:About 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded [â€¦]. It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries.This means that taking at a single cohort of individuals who died in the year 1990 would be biased by the fact that people who identified as left handers were, statistically speaking, a younger group of people.Â  A good explanation of the result of such a bias is provided in a series of letters to the editor regarding the NEJM study, notably this one from epidemiologist Kenneth Rothman:Comparing mean ages at death is a classic fallacy, as it involves comparing only the numerators of rates, rather than the rates themselves. Using the same approach as Halpern and Coren, one would conclude that nursery school is more dangerous than paratrooper training, since the mean age at death of children in nursery school is much lower than that of paratrooper trainees.This same question wasÂ addressed using data from the Danish Twin Registry, which looked at 118 opposite-handed twin pairs to see which individual died first:We compared mortality in a subgroup of 118 opposite-handed twin pairs by counting in how many instances the right-handed twin died first.

Those sites initially reported (without any evidence) that Campos was not an innocent victim wounded in the course of his duties, but was actually suspected of being an accomplice in the mass shooting.On 12 October 2017, an impostor CNN lookalike web site doubled down on that tidbit of fake news by posting an article holding that Campos (whose name was repeatedly misspelled as â€œComposâ€) was not only suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting, but had actually been arrested on the grounds that he, too, shot at concert-goers from the Mandalay Bayâ€™s 32nd floor suite â€” and then shot the real perpetrator in the head (fatally) and himself in the arm (superficially) to provide cover for his actions:Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Compos has been arrested accused of being an accomplice and second shooter in the Las Vegas massacre that claimed the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500.Jesus Campos had originally been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddockâ€™s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds. However, FBI officials involved in the investigation now believe he was an accomplice of Paddockâ€™s, and was involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddockâ€™s 32nd-floor room.According to a senior FBI official, authorities became suspicions by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Camposâ€™ hands and inconsistencies in his timeline of events. â€œWe believe he killed [the shooter], shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator,â€ the FBI official told CNN.Although some confusion remains, as of this writing, about the precise timing of when Campos was wounded relative to the onset of the larger mass shooting rampage, law enforcement has not at any time suggested that Campos was an accomplice to that mass shooting, much less taken him into custody on that basis.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/police-arrest-jesus-campos/,las vegas mass shooting,snopes,us,,,,

Not quite as well known but still fondly remembered by computer aficionados is Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who developed the companyâ€™s first two products (the Apple I and Apple II) but afterwards held a much less visible role in the companyâ€™s operations than Jobs did.What many people donâ€™t know is that Apple actually had a third co-founder, Ronald Wayne.  Wayneâ€™s name (and potential fortune) have been lost in the mists of time because he left Apple and sold off his interest the company early on, thereby letting go of shares that would later be worth billions of dollars.Back in the early days of Apple, when the company was little more than an idea and a name, Steve Jobs brought in Ronald Wayne, a chief draftsman at Atari (where Jobs also worked).  According to Wayne himself, he was brought into the fledgling company as a more mature voice (he was 42, while Jobs and Wozniak were in their 20â€™s) to mediate disagreements between the other two partners:What must be made clear is that I was never actually involved with the soon-to-be-name computer enterprise until a modest philosophical difference arose between Jobs and Wozniak. This difference of opinion led Jobs to confide in me, and seek my advice on how to resolve the issue with his friend. After reflecting on the request, I invited both men to my apartment one evening.  Apparently Jobs had been sufficiently impressed by my diplomatic performance that before the evening was over, he encouraged the three of us to form a partnership. Jobs had concluded that an ideal arrangement would be that he and Wozniak should each hold a 45% stake in the new company, and that I should retain 10% of the voting rights. Jobs felt that in the event of any future policy disputes, he could rely on my vote as the tiebreaker, and that Iâ€™d come down on the side of rationality, rather than emotion.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));As Steve Wozniak outlined in his 2005 autobiography iWoz, Wayne quickly made himself valuable by drawing up the companyâ€™s initial partnership agreement, rendering the first Apple logo, and writing the operating manual for the news companyâ€™s first product, the Apple I:We also met with another guy from Atari, Ron Wayne, who Steve thought could be a partner. I remember meeting him for the first time and thinking, Wow, this guy is amazing. He could just sit at a typewriter and type out our whole legal partnership agreement like heâ€™s a lawyer. He wasnâ€™t a lawyer, but he knew all the legal words. He was a fast talker and he seemed so smart. He was one of those people who seemed to have a quick answer for everything. He seemed to know how to do all the things we didnâ€™t.Ron ended up playing a huge role in those very early days at Apple â€” this was before we had funding, before weâ€™d done much of anything. He was really the third partner, when I think of it. And he did a lot. He wrote and laid out the early operation manual. After all, he could type stuff. And he could draw. He was the one who did the etching of Newton under the Apple tree that was on the computer manual.However, Wayne quickly developed cold feet over Jobsâ€™ taking out too much debt too soon, and just ten days after Appleâ€™s first partnership papers were filed, Wayne bailed on the   nascent computer company:During the first week of my participation in the new Apple Computer Company, everything seemed to be moving along quite nicely, until some news came to light. It was positive for the company, but at the same time, disconcerting for me. Jobs, it seemed, had successfully contracted to sell 100 units of the â€œApple Iâ€ computer to a retail outlet called the Byte Shop.  I was told (from another source) that the Byte Shop had a terrible reputation for not paying their bills. In order to secure the deal, Jobs had to borrow $15,000 to acquire the components and materials to fill the order. Jobs had done exactly what he was supposed to do, but in the process, he had committed the company to a substantial obligation. Since our enterprise was a company and not a corporation, it was an obligation that put me personally on the hook for $1,500 if the Byte Shop did indeed live up to its reputation.  If worse came to worse, I had no idea where Iâ€™d come up with that amount of money. [O]nly a few years earlier, Iâ€™d lived through my own personal corporate failure, and spent years buying back all the stock, and paying off all my creditors.Thereâ€™s no question that this previous experience may have clouded my reasoning at the time, but the circumstances surrounding the Byte Shop order, and the consequent monetary obligation, brought several realities immediately into sharp focus. It was those realities that led me to go back to the Santa Clara Registry Office on April 12, 1976 and remove my name from the Apple partnership.For $800, plus an additional $1,500 he received several months later when Apple incorporated, Wayne gave up his entire ownership interest in the business, thereby trading a 10% share of a company whose market capitalization is now close to $600 billion for roughly $10,000 in 2016 dollars.  Despite what many people might view as a life-crushing reversal, Wayne has consistently maintained that he has never regretted his decision to leave Apple:I havenâ€™t enough fingers and toes to count the number of times over the years that people have asked me (in pitying tones) if Iâ€™d ever regretted my decision. I will state, here and now (but probably not for the last time) that I have never regretted my action. To begin, I had no doubt whatsoever that Apple would be a very successful venture â€” though no one could have anticipated the actual level of that success. At the same time however, it seemed obvious that it was going to be quite a roller-coaster ride. Remember I was 42 years old at the time â€” the â€œold manâ€ of the group â€” while the two Steves were in their twenties. Jobs, in particular, was an absolute whirlwind. It was like having a tiger by the tail. It took little consideration for me to conclude that if I stayed with the enterprise, Iâ€™d probably end up the richest man in the cemetery. Whatâ€™s more, I had the strong feeling that Jobs saw me as someone who could very effectively organize and run the new companyâ€™s documentation system. I felt that this would eventually put me into a large back office, shuffling papers for the rest of my days. Not that such a fate would be a bad thing, but for someone who had inventive passions of his own this was hardly the vision I had in mind for my future.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));The one thing that Wayne does regret?  In the 1990s, when Apple was foundering and the company was the target of takeover rumors, he sold the original 1976 Apple partnership agreement signed by him, Jobs, and Wozniak for $500. In 2011, that document was resold at auction and fetched a whopping $1.6 million.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/third-apple-cofounder/,"apple, Business Ingenuity, steve jobs",snopes,us,,,,

MixtureRATINGMixtureWHAT'S TRUEPolice escorted a small group of picnickers out of San Diego's Chicano Park after they instigated a shouting match with counter-protesters.WHAT'S FALSEPolice received no reports of violent incidents at the event and made no arrests.ORIGINOn 4 September 2017, the right-wing web site Breitbart.com published an article by former California Assemblyman Tim Donnelly reporting that a â€œviolent mobâ€ had descended on a small â€œpro-Donald Trumpâ€ group of people who were present in an historic San Diego park, ostensibly intending to eat a pizza lunch and view cultural murals they were campaigning to have dismantled.In a story headlined â€œViolent Mob Forces Police to Shut Down â€˜Patriot Picnicâ€™ at Chicano Park,â€ Donnelly, a Breitbart contributor, wrote:An explosive confrontation erupted at San Diegoâ€™s Chicano Park Sunday afternoon as an angry mob of several hundred protested a pro-Donald Trump groupâ€™s decision to hold a â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ in the symbolic public space.The â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ tour was captured on YouTube and shows a group of a half dozen or so gathered around a picnic table that is painted the colors of the Mexican flag on an unoccupied side of the park, sandwiched between a busy road and the freeway. They were there ostensibly to eat a pizza lunch, but as one of the group was filming some of the murals and doing his own commentary, a phalanx of San Diego Police formed a line along the sidewalk as the crowd of counter-demonstrators became increasingly agitated.Within minutes, the group was surrounded by hundreds of people, many wearing brown berets and waving Mexican and Communist flags, while filming with phones and trading insults with the pro-Trump demonstrators.Although articleâ€™s headline included the phrase â€œviolent mob,â€ its text, which was aggregated from other sources, didnâ€™t support that wording: San Diego police told us they made no arrests and received no reports of violent activity during the event, while a rally in support of the historic park murals, which depict the culture and history of the predominantly Mexican-American and immigrant community surrounding the park, lasted four hours. A brief but tense confrontation with the â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ attendees lasted about 30 minutes but ended when police escorted them away, and the remainder of event was peaceful. Witnesses told us the â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ group were partially responsible for instigating the confrontation, and both sides could be seen on video taunting each other.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));The â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ event was put together shortly after city officials removed a Confederate plaque from a downtown San Diego Park. According to Roger Ogden, the â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ organizer, the groupâ€™s event was supposed to private, but an online backlash manifested once word of it leaked out. As a result, Ogden told us that the day before the picnic event he issued a press release in the hopes that violence would be averted due to the presence of news media:A few patriots are planning to have a picnic and mural viewing in Chicano Park on Sunday at 1pm. Â This was intended to be a private party, but word got out on social media and plans for a large and violent protest against our little picnic and mural tour developed. Â The â€œcommunity solidarityâ€ protest starts at 12 noon in Chicano Park. Â Our Patriot Picnic and following mural viewing tour starts at 1pm.Opposition to this Patriot Picnic have been whipped up by the San Diego Free Press and other far leftist sites. Â The patriots have received a number of defamatory and intimidating remarks, as well as direct threats of violence. Â After some complaints about these threats, plans for the counter-picnic protest were updated. Â The Brown Berets are now supposed to be there to enforce non-violence, but a large and noisy protest is still expected. Â The â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ group comprised about five men who, roughly two weeks prior, had made a blog post in which they expressed a desire to see Chicano Park, a historic landmark to Latino heritage, â€œtoppled.â€ Once word spread that the men were planning to hold a picnic at the park on 3 September 2017, the community planned a counter-demonstration which came to be known as the â€œSolidarity Rally.â€ About 500 people attended the counter-demonstration, which was organized by the Chicano Park Steering Committee.Ultimately, counter-demonstrators and the San Diego Police Department succeeded in preventing violence. The handful of people who showed up for the â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ were surrounded by a large group of police, while activists from the counter-demonstration side also helped keep the two groups separated.Â According to local news reports, the counter-demonstration started at noon, with speakers including faith and community leaders. Proceedings became heated only briefly when Ogdenâ€™s group showed up at the park at 1 p.m., as scheduled, and set up at a picnic table across the street from the larger event. Three journalists we spoke to who witnessed the incident said Ogdenâ€™s group actively attracted the attention of counter-demonstrators by waving at them. A video posted by â€œPatriot Picnicâ€ participant Arthur Schaper corroborates this, as does a report by the San Diego Union Tribune. Ogden told us that by the time his group started waving, they had already received the crowdâ€™s full attention. ButÂ San Diego Free Press reporter Doug Porter telated a different version of events to us:Arthur Schaper walked to the sidewalk and started waving at [the crowd of counter-demonstrators]. Nobody noticed them until they tried to get their attention. I was on an overpass, I was up there trying to get a shot of the crowd, and I saw him out of the corner of my eye.Â It didnâ€™t take people very long to see them after that.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));Schaper, who narrates the video he posted, can be heard pointing at murals and angrily mis-translating the word â€œyonkesâ€ to mean â€œyankeesâ€ and claiming that the murals were evidence of racial bias. (â€œYonkesâ€ is a Spanish slang word for â€œjunkyards.â€ The Spanish word for â€œyankeeâ€ is more similar in pronunciation to the English version: â€œyanqui.â€) Schaperâ€™s group can be seen yelling greetings in Spanish at counter-demonstrators, at which point a crowd crossed the street and a shouting match between the groups ensued.Shortly afterwards, a police officer told Ogdenâ€™s group that things were â€œgoing south quickâ€ and instructed them to leave. Schaper filmed the groupâ€™s police-escorted exodus from the park, and although the two opposing groups continued shouting at each other, no one was physically assaulted. Multiple witnesses told us that Ogdenâ€™s group was able to walk to their cars and leave peacefully.According to the San Diego Free Press, both Ogden and Schaper areÂ well-knownÂ far-right figures in the community with a storied history of whipping up supporters on topics such as immigration and refugees. The San Diego Union Tribune reported  that Ogden has been behind a number of â€œanti-Muslim and anti-immigrant websites and social media accounts.â€In the days immediately preceding the picnic, Ogden published a post on his â€œPatriot Fireâ€ blog calling for the murals at Chicano Park to be â€œtoppledâ€ and urging supporters to email San Diego city officials calling for the park to be dismantled:Chicano-ism is an odd mixture of La Raza ultra nationalism, Aztec neo-paganism, indigenous racism and Marxist doctrine. The spiritual father of the Chicano / La Raza movement was Jose Vasconcelos, who was a paid, pro-Nazi propagandist during WWII.Chicano Park is also a monument to the Aztecs, who performed mass human sacrifice and took part in ritualistic cannibalism.San Diego Free Press reporter Doug Porter then published an e-mail heâ€™d obtained in which Ogden urged his followers to complain about Chicano Park to San Diego city officials and asked whether anyone would like to visit the â€œcreepy un-Americanâ€ landmark to see it in person. Porter also reported on the broader campaign to do away with the park:City Councilman David Alvarezâ€™s office has received â€œmany racist emailsâ€ calling for the parkâ€™s destruction after an extremist site called for readers â€œto make them more nervous to know that the effort is spreading nationwide.â€It all started with an interview with â€œlocal patriot activistâ€ Jeff Schwilk on Carl Demaioâ€™s radio talk show. The former Minuteman leader commiserated with the host about the indignity of removing a plaque from the Daughters of the Confederacy honoring Jefferson Davis from Horton Plaza, moving on to complain about â€œNazi symbols**â€ and â€œCommunistsâ€ in the murals at Chicano Park.At Roger Ogdenâ€™s Patriot Fire, formerly known as Impeach Obama Now, the plea to contact city officials followed the admonition â€œChicano Park is also a monument to the Aztecs, who performed mass human sacrifice and took part in ritualistic cannibalism. â€eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content','ezslot_6']));In an update appended to that story, Porter presciently noted that â€œMr. Ogden and a small number of his fellow cockroaches WILL likely show up at the park, armed with cameras, hoping to get footage for a YouTube video they can shop to various reactionary media organizations.â€As if on cue, on 4 September 2017 Breitbart.com published their sensationalized story.Sandy Huffaker, the professional news photographer whose pictures Breitbart.com purchased from the stock image service Getty Images for their article, also told us the claim that the counter-protesters were violent was false, saying: â€œThatâ€™s the biggest lie, [Breitbart.com] totally mis-portrayed that.Â Yeah, there was a lot of yelling but there was no violence.â€",mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/patriot-picnic-at-chicano-park/,"breitbart, chicano park, confederate monuments, internet outrage",snopes,us,,,,

MixtureRATINGMixtureWHAT'S TRUEProposed revisions to wind power guidelines could allow wind power companies to injure or kill more bald and golden eagles per year without penalty.WHAT'S FALSEThe revised guidelines are unlikely to lead to thousands of additional eagle deaths because they impose more stringent requirements on wind power companies to minimize such accidents, and there's little evidence that wind turbines currently kill anywhere close to 4,200 eagles per year. ORIGINIn early May 2016, a number of alarmist blog posts reported that President Obama had issued a â€œkill orderâ€ allowing more than 4,000 bald eagles to be slaughtered each year for the next 30 years. A popular versionÂ published by Liberty WritersÂ was heavy-handed with symbolism, maintaining that President Obama â€œreally hatesâ€ bald eagles:Bald Eagles are one of the most enduring symbols of being American. They are a majestic bird of prey. They were on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife until 2007, but were just removed by Obama. They have been endangered for decades, but Obama thinks itâ€™s okay to allow their slaughter.*** Wasnâ€™t he satisfied with killing America already?Obama doesnâ€™t have any issues destroying America. Now, he wants to take down our national symbols. He has also approved the handing out of permits to wind farms that have killed off thousands of Bald Eagles. Obama is doing this in the name of â€œconservation.â€ He and his liberal friends at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service are giving out 30-year-permits to wind farms like candy. He really hates the Bald Eagle.*** No, really. Wait till you see how the are getting killed by the thousands.The basis of this claim was something rather different than what sites such as Liberty Writers were reporting, however. As an ABC News article of 4 May 2016 noted, what has been widely described as a â€œkill orderâ€ for bald eagles is actually revisions to existing wind-energy guidelines that, in part, pertain toÂ accidental bald and golden eagle deaths involving wind turbines. According to the revised guidelines, the time permit of limits granted to wind power companies would be extended from five to 30 years (with renewals still required every five years), and the number of eagles that could permissibly (i.e., without financial penalty) be killed or injured each year by wind power companies would be increased. However, wind power companies would be required to take steps to minimize such losses and would have to take additional measures if they exceeded the stated limits or substantially affected bald or gold eagle populations:The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a new plan that would allow energy companies to operate with permits lasting up to 30 years, while also raising the number of bald eagles they can kill or injure per year without incurring hefty penalties to 4,200, which is nearly four times the current limit.A source within the Obama administration said this is the best plan put forward to actually help conservation efforts, maintaining this new proposal is a â€œstrong protectionâ€ for bald and golden eagles.Currently, wind power companies can hold permits for five years at a time, which, according to the source, doesnâ€™t give companies good financial footing. By extending the permit to 30 years, it can encourage the development of wind energy, a key source of renewable power that has increased exponentially in recent years. The 30-year permits would still have to be reviewed every five years, and companies would have to submit reports of how many eagles they kill or injure.The proposal will grant access to critical data about eagles, the source said. It will also allow the administration to work with companies in where the companies place their machines â€” hopefully to help avoid possible eagle populations.â€œThe permitting system gives us access to eagles and eagle mortalities that we wouldnâ€™t otherwise have,â€ the source said. â€œItâ€™s a great mechanism for us to work proactively to prevent eagle deaths.â€Under the new proposal, companies would pay a $36,000 fee for a permit, which exempts them from the hefty penalties for killing or injuring eagles. Companies would have to commit to take additional measures if they kill or injure more eagles than estimated, or if new information suggests eagle populations are being affected.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));The change in regulations doesnâ€™t mean that power companies are suddenly going to be setting their wind turbines to â€œeagle killâ€ mode and bagging the limit of 4,200 bald eagles per year, however. A 2013 article published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Raptor Research found that â€œconcerns over the effects of [turbine-related deaths] on North Americaâ€™s Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles exist, but are weakly substantiated due to a lack of published documentation of mortalities.â€ That study aimed to â€œsummarize documented cases of eagle mortality at wind energy facilities in the contiguous United Statesâ€ for the 15-year period prior to its publication.Between 1997 and June 2012, researchers identified 85 combined bald eagle and golden eagle fatalities attributed to wind turbines, or roughly 5.6 deaths per year in the entirety of the contiguous United States. Moreover, of those 85 total eagle deaths in a 15-year period, only six were bald eagles. The remaining 79 deceased birds were golden eagles. Those findings were illustrated in a state-by-state table:Additionally, conservationists asserted that the risk posed to eagles by wind turbines was far less than the risk created by the effect of climate change on the birdsâ€™ habitats:Yet many environmentalists say wind power ultimately benefits birds. It is a â€œa growing solution to some of the more serious threats that birds face, since wind energy emits no greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change,â€ Terry Root of Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said in a statement accompanying the studyâ€™s release.[In September 2014], a National Audubon Society report said that hundreds of bird species in the U.S. â€” including the bald eagle and eight state birds, from Idaho to Maryland â€” are at â€œserious riskâ€ due to climate change. It said some species are forecast to lose more than 95% of their current ranges.â€œOur scientists are still reviewing this particular study,â€ says Audubon spokesman David Ringer.

However, there is littleÂ evidence that many eagles have been killed or injured under the existing rules, and the revisions are balanced by requirements that wind power companies implement more stringent safeguards to protect such animals, such as enabling the collection of valuable information about eagles, and helping to foster sources of energy (such as wind power) that do not threaten eagles through the degradation of their existing habitats.",mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-gives-kill-order-for-bald-eagles/,"bald eagles, barack obama, liberty writers, mrctv",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINThe strange and spooky tale of a town known as Ashley, Kansas (and the fate of its more than 670 residents) after an anomalous incident in 1952 has circulated the Internet for several years. In terms of unexplained events, itâ€™s an interesting narrative: a middle-of-the-night earthquake followed weeks of strange happenings; and the town of Ashley â€” along with everyone who lived there â€” abruptly disappeared. But if you search for any historical mention of Ashley, Kansas, youâ€™ll come up short. No such town is shown on any period maps, nor is it included in any census records. In March 2012, what was likely the first version of the Ashley, Kansas, story was published to a popular creepypasta wiki (i.e., a site for short horror stories that are especially frightening or unnerving) in a version that began as follows:Sometime during the night of August 16, 1952, the small town of Ashley, Kansas ceased to exist. At 3:28am on August 17, 1952, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake itself was felt throughout the state and most of the midwest. The epicenter was determined to be directly under Ashley, Kansas.When state law enforcement arrived at what should have been the outskirts of the farming community, they found a smoldering, burning fissure in the earth measuring 1,000 yards in length and approximately 500 yards in width. The depth of the fissure was never determined.After twelve days, the state-wide and local search for the missing 679 residents of Ashley, Kansas, was called off by the Kansas State Government at 9:15pm on the night of August 29, 1952. All 679 residents were assumed to be dead. At 2:27am on August 30, 1952, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake was measured by the United States Geological Survey. The epicenter was situated under what used to be the location of Ashley, Kansas. When law enforcement investigated at 5:32am, they reported that the fissure in the Earth had closed.In the eight days leading up to the disappearance of the town and its 679 residents, bizarre and unexplainable events were reported by dozens of residents in Ashley, Kansas and law enforcement from the surrounding area.This story is classic creepypasta: a chillingly fun, but decidedly fictional, tale. In addition to the version cited above, a story titled â€œThe Disappearance of Ashley, Kansasâ€ was subsequently posted to Redditâ€™s r/nosleep forum, a site devoted to sharing works of horror fiction. Prior to those Internet mentions in 2012, Ashley existed neither in reality nor imagination.  Moreover, only one earthquake was recorded in Kansas in 1952, and that event occurred in April rather than August. An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 to 7.9 hitting Kansas would have become local, if not national, lore (much less a pair of such earthquakes occurring within two weeks of each other at the same site), yet no record of such a geological occurrence exists.  And even if, in typical conspiracy theory fashion, the powers that be conspired to conceal whatever purportedly happened in Ashley, proof of the townâ€™s existence would remain in other texts, maps, and records antedating 1952.

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINOn 25 April 2016, the web site Patriot Nation published an articleÂ reporting that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) now officially condones pedophilia, and that the group had deemed it â€œnormalâ€ for adults to be sexually attracted to children. Â The article implied that growing acceptance of gay and transgender rights had created a cascadeÂ of escalating acceptance for other behaviors previously regarded as deviant:Ever since the government began its quest to â€œnormalizeâ€ homosexuality and other perverse sexual behavior, conservatives have been saying itâ€™s a slippery slope. After what happened at an academic conference at the University of Cambridge, itâ€™s safe to say they were right.The â€œClassifying Sex: Debating DSM-5â€ conference featured speakers who condoned pedophilia as â€œnatural and normal for males.â€A proposal was being discussed which would essentially normalize hebephilia, the sexual preference for children in early puberty, typically 11 to 14-year-olds. The argument was made that since children are reaching puberty earlier than ever before, sex with 11 to 14-year-olds should not be considered wrong.That this was even a topic of discussion among the worlds leading psychiatrists is incredibly alarming, but the conference took matters one step further by claiming that â€œat least a sizable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children, and normal males are aroused by children.â€Ultimately, the proposal to include hebephilia as a legitimate disorder in the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association manual was defeated, and sex offenders are thrilled.TheÂ articleÂ (which didnâ€™t offer veryÂ many details at all)Â cited a January 2016 blog post about the purported academic conference where this pronouncement was made, stating that the event had occurred â€œlast yearâ€:These sentiments were discussed at a conference that took place last year to discuss the classification of sexuality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the standard international psychiatric manual used by the legal system.The conference, which was titled â€œClassifying Sex: Debating DSM-5â€³, had featured a number of speakers who spoke in favor of sex with children, which, in essence, is supporting pedophilia.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));That blog, in turn, referenced a 2014 article fromÂ The Telegraph, which reported on papers that had been presented at aÂ University of Cambridge conference back in July 2013:â€œPaedophilic interest is natural and normal for human males,â€ said the presentation. â€œAt least a sizeable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children â€¦ Normal males are aroused by children.â€The statement that paedophilia is â€œnatural and normalâ€ was made not three decades ago but last July. It was made not in private but as one of the central claims of an academic presentation delivered, at the invitation of the organisers, to many of the key experts in the field at a conference held by the University of Cambridge.In other academic quarters, with rather fewer excuses, that lack of understanding appears to be reasserting itself. The Cambridge University conference, on July 4-5 last year, was about the classification of sexuality in the DSM, a standard international psychiatric manual used by the police and courts.It is true that the conference was for academic discussion and debate of the DSM-5 (short for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), which standardizes classifications of mental disorders in the United States, and that theÂ DSM-IV standardsÂ were revised and updated in May 2013. However, the supposed cause-and-effect chronology implied here (by the Patriot Nation article and others) is clearly askew, as University of Cambridge event occurred two months after theÂ American Psychiatric Association revised their classifications.Itâ€™s also true that the DSM-5 slightly adjustedÂ their classification of pedophilia, defining it as â€œa sexual orientation or profession of sexual preference devoid of consummation,â€ and supplanting the common usage of the word with â€œpedophilic disorder,â€and that the DSM-5 does not classify hebephilia (attraction to pubescent, rather than pre-pubescent, children) as a mental disorder. But the decision to omit the latter fromÂ the updated manual had nothing to do with either societal acceptance of LGBT issues or the 2013 Cambridge University conference.A representative from theÂ American Psychiatric AssociationÂ toldÂ us that the organization doesÂ not condone pedophilia, nor does it espouse the position that sexual attraction to children is normal or healthy.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/american-psychiatric-association-pedophilia/,"american psychiatric association, dsm-5, misleading, pedophilia",snopes,us,,,,

While a â€œsecret wireâ€ could have been concealed in her dress, a wire connected to an earpiece mounted in or behind her ear would have been noticeable.Moreover, the questions asked of the candidates during the first debate posed no surprises â€” they were obvious queries that both sides should have anticipated and prepped for, and therefore neither should have needed offstage help with their responses.This isnâ€™t the first time that a harmless microphone wire has been mistaken for something sinister.

Official with Whom He Negotiated a Nuclear Deal?,FALSE,U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hide a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he negotiated a nuclear deal.,"CLAIM					U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hide a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he negotiated a nuclear deal.									FalseRATINGFalseeval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-under_page_title-1000009','ezslot_0']));ORIGINOn 28 July 2015, the web site of Allen B. West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal.According to that article (â€œYou will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerryâ€™s daughterâ€™s weddingâ€), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iranâ€™s development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal â€” so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerryâ€™s daughter was Zarifâ€™s son:You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerryâ€™s younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed.Of course youâ€™re not aware of it.Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brianâ€™s Persian birth name is â€œBehrooz Vala Nahidâ€ but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to â€œBrian Nahed.â€ At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahedâ€™s Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)â€™s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years.Gosh, I wonder why??Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain.Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerryâ€™s chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations.Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening.But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerryâ€™s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarifâ€™s son.Does this bother anyone at all?Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughterâ€™s marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were â€œtoo politeâ€ to bring it up.As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran.And unfortunately, weâ€™re going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live.All of this information was wrong.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_4']));Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerryâ€™s daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). All of this information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site:Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas [low grade and high grade], metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahedâ€™s clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation.Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the departmentâ€™s Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center.Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. Heâ€™s a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life. More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarifâ€™s son: he doesnâ€™t know either of them, and Zarifâ€™s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarifâ€™s son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarifâ€™s son was not at her wedding:Persian Shrug http://t.co/BtnKMzXM27 via @po_st Happy 2 verify. No wedding party when we married. No Zarifâ€™s son. Sorry 2 disappoint.â€” Vanessa Kerry (@VBKerry) August 2, 2015The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahedâ€™s parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brianâ€™s father also works as a physician).eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_6']));As for the rest of the â€œfactsâ€ presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry â€œonly revealed his daughterâ€™s marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of Stateâ€ in 2013. By the articleâ€™s own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full â€œPersianizedâ€ versions of Brianâ€™s parentsâ€™ names â€” something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry:The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated.Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery.More absurdly, the articleâ€™s statement that â€œeven the official [New York Times] wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)â€™s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college yearsâ€ was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the brideâ€™s birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahedâ€™s familial connection to Iran would â€œcarefully avoid any referenceâ€ to his â€œforeignâ€ birthplace of New York.Finally, the unsourced statement that â€œSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.â€ is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iranâ€™s minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senateâ€™s Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. Itâ€™s hardly a â€œsurpriseâ€ to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countriesâ€™ national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countriesâ€™ official representatives.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/persian-shrug/,"allen b. west, conservative tribune, iran nuclear talks, john kerry, john kerry son in law, kerry best man, mohammed javad zarif, vanessa kerry",snopes,us,,,,

Did he just accidentally fill out the form incorrectly? Is he the victim of a malicious voter impersonation scheme? Unfortunately, thereâ€™s absolutely no way to know for sure, because he has yet to provide WIRED with a comment. But based on his recent history with paperwork, option two seems like a pretty safe bet.The story went viral, in part because Kushner has a long history of allegedly misfiling forms, most infamouslyÂ his national security questionnaires â€” which have, at various times, omitted numerous foreign contacts and which at one point listed some graduation dates and his own father-in-lawâ€™s address incorrectly.Wiredâ€™s information came from liberal opposition research group American Bridge, who used a third-party information source separate from the New York voter registration system to uncover the information about his voter registration status. LaterÂ reporting from the New York Daily News, however,Â quoted members of the New York City Board of Elections who said the blame was theirs â€” a data entry issue that likely stemmed from his gender being listed as â€œunknownâ€ in earlier New Jersey registration rolls prior to filing in New York:The Nexis data cited by Wired is from 2009. In a New Jersey voter registration before 2009, Kushnerâ€™s gender was listed as â€œunknown.â€Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan confirmed that this was an error on the boardâ€™s part.

This mix-up, which was corrected internally after the story came out, cannot be blamed on Kushnerâ€™s own inability to fill out his New York voter registration correctly;Â New York Daily News obtained Kushnerâ€™sÂ  2011 New York City voter registration form, which clearly shows he checked off the box marked â€œmaleâ€:We have reached out to the New York City Board of Elections to verify if the Daily News reporting is accurate, and will update this page if anything comes to light that changes that view.Â  However, as the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections is on record as saying the mix up was a data-entry issue and not a filing issue, we rank the claim that Jared Kushner registered to vote as a female in New York as false.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jared-kushner-register-vote-new-york-woman/,"elections, jared kushner, kushner, voter fraud, voting",snopes,us,,,,

Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions. Many clouds start with uniform regions that could show iridescence but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors. The above iridescent cloud was photographed in 2009 from the Himalayan Mountains in Nepal, behind the 6,600-meter peak named Thamserku.Itâ€™s possibleÂ that when these two images â€”Â one showingÂ realÂ iridescent clouds in the Himalayan mountains, the other an artistâ€™s rending of a weather machine â€” were circulating in 2010, the caption toÂ Bartunovâ€™s real photograph was accidentally shared along withÂ Harrisonâ€™s computer generated image.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spiral-cloud-formation-himalayas/,"clouds, fauxtography, himalayas, Natural Phenomena",snopes,us,,,,

Research In ProgressRATINGResearch In ProgressORIGINIn lateÂ  November 2017 FacebookÂ user Laura Waltenburg posted a heartwarming story about online retailer Chewy.comâ€™s purported response to a request for a refund after her sisterâ€™s two dogs died. She said that two bags of dog food that her sister had ordered arrived after the dogs had passed away:My sister and brother-in-law tragically lost both of their dogs this past weekend. After this happened they received two 40 pound bags of dog food that they had ordered from Chewy.com. My brother-in-law sent them an email requesting permission to send the dog food back for refund minus the shipping cost. They responded with unbelievable kindness. They credited their credit card for the full purchase price and asked them to donate the dog food to a local shelter. They sent a second email requesting a picture of one of the dogs to put in there memorial book to honor her. And then today my sister and brother-in-law received these beautiful flowers from Chewy.com. I wish I could tell everybody this story. This is the kind of story that needs to go viral. This is an incredible company.Waltenburgâ€™s post gained popularity in mid December 2017.

Timothy M. Kaine (D) for the directive, but Kaineâ€™s office said the police superintendent issued the directive.In a statement, Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the State Police superintendent, said he asked chaplains to offer nondenominational prayers at department-sanctioned public events but that the request does not apply to private ceremonies or individual counseling.Flaherty said his decision was in response to a recent federal appeals court ruling that a Fredericksburg City Council member may not pray â€œin Jesusâ€™s nameâ€ during council meetings because the opening invocation is government speech.According to theÂ Post and other sources, Kaine did not initiate the directive (although he did support the superintendentâ€™s decision). And despite attempts by partisan media outlets to portray the troopersâ€™ leaving their voluntary chaplain posts as â€œfiringsâ€ or â€œforced resignations,â€ all sixÂ resigned by choice to protest the new rule.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_7']));â€œWhile the executive staff and Col.

W. Steven Flaherty, the State Police superintendent, earlier this month had instructed his departmentâ€™s 17 chaplains to abide by a recent federal court decision upholding the constitutionality of nonsectarian prayers at government functions. At public functions, officers are permitted to use only nondenominational prayers.In protest, six of the chaplains resigned those duties.Flaherty cited the court decision â€” the case involved a challenge to a Fredericksburg City Council rule requiring nondenominational prayers prior to public meetings â€” in a written statement about the new policy.â€œThe department recognizes the importance as a state government agency to be inclusive and respectful of the varied ethnicities, cultures, and beliefs of our employees, their families and citizens at large,â€ Flaherty said in a statement.It also noted that the restriction applies only to sanctioned government events, not private functions at which a chaplain is asked to preside.Republican Gov.Â Bob McDonnell directed the police superintendent to reinstate sectarian prayers after assuming office in 2010.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tim-kaine-fired-police-chaplains/,"election 2016, religion, Tim Kaine",snopes,us,,,,

UnprovenRATINGUnproveneval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_page_title-1000009','ezslot_0']));ORIGINThe idea that women living or working in proximity to one another synchronize their menstrual cycles is particularly persistent, and has now become accepted as conventional wisdom.Â However, itâ€™s a relatively new idea â€”Â it has its origins in a survey conducted on a population of college students at an all-female college published in Nature in 1971Â â€” and wasÂ based on a small population monitored only for about eight menstrual cycles. It found that there was increased synchronization between roommates and close friends:There was a significant increase in synchronization (that is, a decrease in the difference between onset dates) among roommates, among closest friends and among roommates and closest friends combined. The increase in synchrony for roommates did not differ significantly from the increase for closest friends.There were then, and are now, many biologically-informed explanations for such a phenomenon, referred to in the scientific community as â€œsocially mediated synchronyâ€, discussed by University of Oxford anthropologist Alexandra Alvergne:There have been many evolutionary arguments for why females would synchronise the timing of sexual receptivity. These theories [â€¦] assume that synchrony would serve to maximise the reproductive success of females (and also sometimes males). The most popular one is that it enables females to minimise the risk of being monopolised by a single dominant male, and thus make it easier to engage in polyandry. [â€¦]In this vein, a meta-analysis of 19 primate species found that the degree to which a dominant male would father all offspring was inversely related to the degree to which the females synchronised their cycles. In other words, a dominant male had less control over reproduction if all females were receptive at the same time.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));The method by which humans could signal each otherâ€™s cycle to nearby females, similarly, is not without broad biologic grounding, as laboratory experiments suggest that humans can unknowingly react to the pheromones of others in a way that can affect menstruation. The presence or absence of socially mediated synchrony in humans has been investigated, with varying degrees of scientific and quantitative rigor, in a variety of social contexts including roommates, lesbian couples, co-workers, close-friends, and various combinations of these social relationships, ever since.While some studies do demonstrate the presence of menstrual syncing, these small scale studies have been called into question. The literature provides far from conclusive evidence for the existence of menstrual synchrony at all, and increasingly researchers are finding methodological and theoretical flaws in the work with suggesting its existence. This was discussed in a 2006 study titled â€œWomen Do Not Synchronize Their Menstrual Cyclesâ€ which, true to its title, found no evidence for synchrony:Since the publication of the [1971 Nature] study, a number of studies have been conducted, with some apparently replicating the finding of synchrony, while others failed. Subsequent methodological critiques have argued that serious errors occurred in studies reporting synchrony. Thus, while menstrual synchrony among women is widely believed to occur and argued to be adaptive, its very existence is scientifically controversial.Another 2006 study attempted to replicate the results of the first 1971 study with less problematic statistical approaches, finding:Women within units (pairs and triples) did not synchronize their menstrual cycles. No statistically significant changes were found in any of the comparisons made, and the mean differences observed for all comparisons were close to the expected mean difference of 7.5 days. [â€¦]The negative results of this study add to the growing body of evidence undermining the existence of menstrual synchrony in human females. Menstrual synchrony has never been demonstrated in any unindustrialized, natural fertility, hunter-gatherer population.From a mathematical perspective, most critiques of studies purporting to find positive results focus on the demonstrable likelihood that perceived synchrony happens by chance or by viewing data through a biased lens. A 1992 review argued that the studies demonstrating a menstrual syncing have used methods that â€œincrease the probability of finding menstrual synchrony in a sample.â€ This study used a mathematical proof to demonstrate that the trends demonstrated in these studies are likely based on chance alone:[These studies] assume that a decrease in onset differences between pairs of subjects over the same number of onsets is an indication of menstrual synchrony.Â  At the beginning of the observation period, approximately one-half of the pairs of a sample have onset differences that are decreasing over the same number of menstrual cycles. [â€¦]Thus, over the first several onsets, whether the onset difference of randomly paired subjects remains constant, increases, or decreases is due to the chance factors of the subjectsâ€™ relative mean menstrual cycle lengths and the order of their initial onset dates.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));A 1997 study utilized a comparably large amount of data gathered from women of the Dogon hunter-gatherer society in Mali, finding no evidence of synchrony. This population was selected because evolutionary explanations for synchrony would, many biologists argue, best be tested in a â€œnatural fertilityâ€ population in which â€œcouples do not attempt to control their fertility in a parity-dependent [based on how many pregnancies a woman has had] fashionâ€, as these were the conditions underÂ which human reproductivity evolved:The lack of empirical support for menstrual synchrony among the Dogon and in Western populations does not establish the species wide absence of the phenomenon, but it shifts the burden of proof onto those who argue that the phenomenon exists.While later studies have also failed to empirically demonstrate it exists, the issue was brought back into the limelight when the period-tracking App â€œClueâ€ teamed up with Oxford anthropologist Alex Alvergne (cited earlier). On 9 March 2017, they described a pilot study on their website (which was not published as a peer-reviewed study) based on data collected in the app:Thanks to our global community tracking every day [â€¦] weâ€™re able to test these commonly held beliefs with data, so we started an investigation to see if cycles really sync.We reached out to Clue users and asked if they thought their cycles had been syncing with someone (who also uses Clue). [â€¦] We received over 1,500 responses and narrowed it down to 360 pairs with at least three cycles over a similar time period that we were able to review [who did not use hormonal birth control].We analyzed a minimum of three consecutive cycles for each of those pairs and found that 273 pairs actually had a larger difference in cycle start dates at the end of the study than at the beginning of the study. Only 79 of the pairs behaved the opposite way, with the gap between cycle start dates narrowing over the course of the study.Though not as statistically involved an analysis as some of the published studies, this report does make use of a large dataset and finds, again, no evidence to support synchrony in menstrual cycles. In a piece for The Conversation on the topic, written before the Clue post, Alvergne said:As disappointing as it may be, it seems that there is now overwhelming evidence to suggest that menstrual synchrony in humans is no more than a methodological artifact from one study that has since turned into an urban myth.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content','ezslot_6']));An additional aspect may be attributed, according to the author of the 1997 study, to human bias:Given the paucity of evidence, it is surprising that belief in menstrual synchrony is so widespread.I suggest that this belief arises, in part, from a popular misconception about how far apart one would expect the menstrual onsets of two women to be by chance alone. If two women both have 30-day menstrual cycles, the maximum they can be out of phase is 5 days, and, on average, their onsets date expected to be 7.5 days apart.Fully half the time then onsets should be closer than 7.5 days. If menstrual synchrony among friends has psychological appeal, then onsets that happen to be close together may make a greater impression than onsets that happen to be disparate.We rate this claim as unproven due to an increasing lack of scientific evidence demonstrating that menstrual synchrony exists at all, but at the same time, we allow that the topic is complicated by myriad confounding variables.",unproven,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/menstrual-cycles-synchronize/,"menstrual periods, periods, women",snopes,us,,,,

Such an occurrence would involve an anomalous loss of water, which would be documentable via a variety of scientifically rigorous methods.The obvious approach would be to look at water levels from areas near the Mississippi River and close to the New Madrid fault and see if the current levels there are lower than usual when compared with historical data, and this is the approach USGS Research Statistician David Smith took when we asked him about the â€œgoing dryâ€ claim. As an example, he pulled up historical data from a well in the the town of Caruthersville, Missouri, which lies directly over the New Madrid fault and adjacent to the Mississippi River. Its levels were normal (if not higher than average) for this time of year, Smith told us:The Caruthersville well lies directly over the New Madrid Fault and it shows that its is normal for this time of year. In fact, it is well above its low during the 2012 drought.Smith also took umbrage at the video makerâ€™s claim that there has been no drought in the area that could be responsible for differing water levels. This, too, he told us, is false:The Bootheel, Southeast Ozarks, and the area covering the New Madrid fault have been abnormally dry despite what the creator of the video states. Water levels are somewhat low for this time of year but they are well within normal range. Farmers have pumped a lot of water for irrigation the past few months.John Schumacher, the supervisory hydrologist at the USGS-Missouri Water Science Center, took another approach to the problem. Schumacher compared the riverâ€™s flow both upstream and downstream of the New Madrid fault and found no evidence of a â€œmysteryâ€ lost flow:I pulled the last 30 days flow from Mississippi River at Thebes and the Ohio River at Olmsted (both upstream of the New Madrid) and Mississippi River at Memphis (downstream New Madrid).The 30-day average flow of Thebes plus The Ohio is ~217,000 ft/s compared to ~249,000 at Memphis. So there is no â€œmysteryâ€ lost flow as the Mississippi River flows through the New Madrid Zone. There is the expected slight increase from smaller ungaged tributaries in between Thebes and Memphis and diffuse GW inflow.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000008','ezslot_4']));In the video, the narrator makes the claim that the opening of the New Madrid fault (which does not show up in hydrologic data) could perhaps be attributed to the devastating earthquakes that struck Mexico in late 2017:What if something triggered the New Madrid? Not to a complete quake yet because there have been no significant quakes along the New Madrid. All Iâ€™m saying is there was a lot of movement, a big thrust, especially with the 8 pointer [in Mexico], what if the water is disappearing. Iâ€™m just trying to think outside the box here. What if the water is disappearing into that fracture. Because itâ€™s right above the New Madrid fault zone.Although the seismologists whom we spoke with were not comfortable using absolute terms such as â€œimpossible,â€ they were skeptical that the Mexico quakes would have had much effect on conditions along the New Madrid fault 1,200 miles away. William Newman, a professor of seismology at UCLA, told us that â€œHow much stress from the Mexican event can increase the likelihood or probability of rupture near the New Madrid fault is very difficult to ascertain, but is likely very small.â€Regardless of seismological explanations (or lack thereof), claims that the Mississippi River is losing an anomalous amount of water through some unexplained process are false. The riverâ€™s water is where scientists expect it to be, in normal quantities.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mississippi-river-going-dry/,"mississippi river, new madrid fault",snopes,us,,,,

And the desperation on the island, parts of which may remain without power for months.Until then, Cruz had not been a well-known politician outside the island.But after she criticized Washingtonâ€™s response to the hurricane this week â€” â€œsave us from dying,â€ she pleaded on cable network â€” President Trump took direct aim at her on Twitter.â€œSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan,â€ he wrote Saturday.Â Democrats must have told her to say nasty things about him, he claimed.Immediately after this, rumors popped up about Cruz and her leadership (or lack thereof), up to and including a snippet from a Puerto Rico radio program purporting to be an interview with a police officer (but without any corroborating evidence or citations to support her claims; not even a name from the radio show caller claiming to be a police officer):eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));On September 28th A cop from Puerto Rico was able to get a call through a Hispanic radio station in New York (La Mega).

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINVersions of a â€œWalmart cash back scamâ€ e-mail warning have been circulating since late 2004, all of them featuring the scenario of a WalMart customer who uses a credit/debit card that is charged for a cash back amount even though the shopper did not request cash back and was handed no cash by the cashier, with the discrepancy being noticed only when the shopper spots the added cash back amount on the receipt:[Collected via e-mail, November 2004]Something happened to me this past weekend that I wanted to alert everyone I know to be on the look-out for while shopping at Wal Mart, especially during the busy holiday season. This trip I had a buggy full buying stuff to outfit the deer camp and the usual purchases for home, in other words I had over $200 worth of goods to buy. When I checked out, I ran my Wal Mart credit card through the machine and pressed â€œNoâ€ to the question of â€œDo you want $20 cash back?â€The checker fooled around with the register and then asked me to run the card again because it did not work the first time. I donâ€™t recall pressing â€œNoâ€ again or even if the question came up on the card terminal. My biggest concern at that time was making sure I picked up all the bags around that carousel they use to bag your purchases. While I was moving my bags back to the cart, I didnâ€™t pay any attention to my receipt. Anyway, the next morning I looked at my receipt (I usually just throw it away without looking at it!) There was a line on it that read â€œ$20.00 Cash Backâ€ and another that said â€œChange Due 20.00.â€I called the manager and told him what happened and that I did not request $20.00 back, nor did I get $20.00 back. He did not seem a bit surprised. It seems that is a scheme the cashiers use to slip $20.00 in their pockets at the customers expense. The manager said I could come back to the store for the credit but now I wonder how many times this has happened to me in the past that I did not catch. I am not sure if the cashier can override the â€œNoâ€ or if she charged the extra $20.00 during the second swipe of the card. At least this time, she got caught the next day but I would have loved to have caught her in the act the day it happened.Please pay attention to your receipt and donâ€™t let these thieves steal your hard earned money!![Collected via e-mail, June 2009]Just to alert everyone. My co worker went to Milford DE Walmart last week. She had her items rung up by the cashier. The cashier hurried her along and didnâ€™t give her a receipt. She asked the cashier for a receipt and the cashier was annoyed and gave it to her. My co worker didnâ€™t look at her receipt until later that night. The receipt showed that she asked for $20 cash back. SHE DID NOT ASK FOR CASH BACK. My co worker called Walmart who investigated but could not see the cashier pocket the money. She then called her niece who works for the bank and her niece told her this. There is a scam going on. The cashier will ask for cash back and hand it to her friend who is the next person in line. Please, Please, please check your receipts right away when using debit cards. The store has the cashier under investigation now. We can only pray that she is caught very soon.I am adding to this. My husband and I were in WalMart North Salisbury and paying with credit card when my husband went to sign the credit card signer he just happen to notice there was a $20 cash back added. He told the cashier that he did not ask nor want cash back and she said this machine has been messing up and she canceled it. We really didnâ€™t think anything of it until we read this email. Please be aware.[Collected via e-mail, July 2009]It happened to me at Wal-Mart (Supercenter Store #1279, 10411 N Freeway 45, Houston, TX 77037) a month ago. I bought a bunch of stuff, over $150, & I glanced at my receipt as the cashier was handing me the bags. I saw a cash-back of $40. I told her I didnâ€™t request a cash back & to delete it. She said Iâ€™d have to take the $40 because she couldnâ€™t delete it. I told her to call a supervisor. Supervisor came & said Iâ€™d have to take it. I said NO! Taking the $40 would be a cash advance against my Discover & I wasnâ€™t paying interest on a cash advance!!!!! If they couldnâ€™t delete it then they would have to delete the whole order. So the supervisor had the cashier delete the whole order & re-scan everything! The second time I looked at the electronic pad before I signed & a cash-back of $20 popped up. At that point I told the cashier & she deleted it. The total came out right. The cashier agreed that the electronic pad must be defective. Obviously the cashier knew the electronic pad was defective because she NEVER offered me the $40 at the beginning. Can you imagine how many people went through before me & at the end of her shift how much money she pocketed?In concept, this item was similar to an earlier piece which spread the false claim that gas stations were imposing surreptitious $10.00 surcharges on credit card customers. The similarity is that in both cases, it appears that an erroneous â€œscamâ€ rumor originated because a customer misunderstood or misinterpreted something that happened to her while shopping and, despite not having any evidence of a deliberate attempt to defraud, was quick to write and circulate a message erroneously accusing retailers of wrongdoing.We investigated a number of different WalMart stores in different areas (along with outlets of other general merchandising and grocery store chains), and we spoke with (both in person and via e-mail) numerous people who were currently working as cashiers for a number of different retailers, including WalMart. In not one single case did we find a store with a checkout system that allowed cashiers to initiate cash back transactions on customersâ€™ cards on their own, without any involvement, knowledge, or approval on the customerâ€™s part. There was simply no way for a cashier working at any of these businesses to surreptitiously place a cash back charge on a customerâ€™s card and furtively pocket the money, all without the customerâ€™s requesting or knowing about it. As various WalMart cashiers told us:We CANNOT request cash back. The â€œbuttonsâ€ that you press to say no [to the â€œDo you want cash back?â€ prompt] or request a [cash back] amount are very close together. People accidently press the wrong ones all the time. We as cashiers have no control over this. Also, if you look up on the pole that has the register number on it, there is a black bubble. THAT is a camera that they use to watch us. They check those all the time. The only way we could steal the customerâ€™s money would be to print their check for more than the total. That could be easily checked by the customer when we hand it back to them.On the article about the â€œCash Back Scamâ€, I have been a Walmart cashier for 13 years now, and have had many odd things happen â€” but in NO case, as you stated in your article â€” have I ever seen a customer get cash back without asking for it, either accidentally or on purpose.Even if a customer does hand us their debit card, we still are unable to ask for extra cash back. It is always initiated on the customerâ€™s side. We never have any control over this.We have been accused of it when a customer isnâ€™t expecting cash back, but to my knowledge, it is simply impossible for us to actually ask for extra cash back off their card.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));In every case of customersâ€™ complaining about getting cash back from credit/debit card purchases without having requested it that we were able to track down, the cause turned out to be that those customers didnâ€™t pay close enough attention to the prompts on the card processing keypads or simply pressed the wrong keys by mistake. And in nearly every one of those cases it was verifiable that the complaining customers had in fact been handed the appropriate amount of cash back by their cashiers (even though they insisted they hadnâ€™t requested it).It is possible (and sometimes occurs) that a cashier will actually reach over and manipulate the customer keypad herself to initiate a cash back request unbeknownst to the customer, but this form of theft requires that the customerâ€™s attention be completely diverted elsewhere, and it canâ€™t be done surreptitiously â€” the action takes place in full view of other employees, customer, and security cameras (and hence such perpetrators are easily caught).",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cash-back-scam/,ATM Scams,snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINVeterans Day (known prior to 1954 as Armistice Day) is a U.S. holiday that celebrates the service of all U.S. military veterans and is observed on November 11 to coincide with the date of the signing of the 1918 armistice that brought an end to hostilities in World War I.  Although annual presidential proclamations calling for the observance of Armistice Day on November 11 were not issued until 1926, and Armistice Day was not designated as a U.S. federal holiday until 1938,  Armistice Day was first celebrated in 1919:President Wilson proclaimed the first Armistice Day with the following words: â€œTo us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the countryâ€™s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations.â€Each year on Veterans Day a national ceremony is held at Arlington National Cemetery (usually attended by the President of the United States or, in his absence, another high government official) which includes a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknowns.  Local observances typically include speeches from dignitaries, parades, moments of silence, and prayer ceremonies.  Ravioli is a traditional Italian food consisting of a filling enclosed within two layers of thin egg pasta dough, served in broth or with a pasta sauce. The type of ravioli most familiar to Americans is a canned version filled with beef or processed cheese and served in a tomato-based sauce.  eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));Save for the fact that tinned ravioli was developed around the time of World War I, there is no connection between that food and Veterans Day, as asserted in a now common rumor:A little known fact about Veterans Day, it was originally celebrated with a dinner of ravioli. This was tradition was started by Woodrow Wilson, who invited 2,000 veterans to the White House for a dinner of ravioli on the first Veterans Day. Wilson served ravioli because the canning industry was on the rise and he predicted that ravioli would soon be the a popular meal for Americans. Since then, ravioli has been considered the traditional meal for November 11th.The rumor that ravioli is a â€œtraditional mealâ€ on Veterans Day, a tradition initiated when President Woodrow Wilson supposedly served a ravioli dinner to 2,000 veterans who visited the White House on 11 November 1919, originated with a spurious edit made to Wikipediaâ€™s article about Veterans Day on 11 November 2010, which added the following paragraph:Because it is a federal holiday, many Americans have the day off from school or work for Veterans Day. Non-essential federal government offices are closed. All federal employees are paid for the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive wages for that day in addition to holiday pay. The holiday is often celebrated by having a ravioli meal. This tradition dates back to the ending days of World War I when President Wilson, aware that the returning soldiers would be longing for home cooked meals, invited 2,000 soldiers to the White House and helped his staff chefs cook them ravioli, which had just become a mainstay in mainstream American kitchens due to commercial canning. In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War years: â€œHunger,â€ he remarked, â€œbreeds madness.â€None of the sources cited in that paragraph supported the historical notion of ravioli as a traditional Veterans Day meal, though.  The first footnote simply referenced a 2009  article from the Lebanon, Ohio, Western Star newspaper that coincidentally mentioned ravioli was being served as part of the lunch menu at a local school on Veterans Day.  The other footnote cited a page in The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink that provided a source for Woodrow Wilsonâ€™s Armistice Day statement about hunger breeding madness rather than reform, and that mentioned how the rise in commercial canning after World War I had popularized Americanized versions of ethnic dishes such as ravioli â€” but it offered no connection between those two topics.  (President Wilson hosted no dinners for anyone at the White House in November 1919, as he had suffered a debilitating stroke the previous month and remained in seclusion.)The false information about a Veterans Day-ravioli connection persisted on Wikipedia for exactly a year, until it was finally removed via another edit on Veterans Day 2011.  During that time, however, the apocryphal tale of President Wilsonâ€™s purportedly initiating the tradition by serving a ravioli dinner to a group of veterans at the White House in 1919 was uncritically picked up and cited as fact by a number of other sources, such as a 2011 Examiner.com article:A lot of restaurants offer free meals to veterans on Veterans Day. They can order whatever they want from the menu. However, when President Woodrow Wilson designated November 11, 1919 as Veterans Day [sic], he opened up the kitchen of the White House and helped cooked [sic] ravioli for the veterans.He reasoned that the veterans might want a home cooked meal after returning from World War I. Since the veterans had survived on military rations for such a long time that a home cooked meal would be an appropriate gesture for them.There was no steak dinner because at the time the nation was in a food shortage and rationing was taking place.One of the new trends in food was ravioli, an Italian import that usually provided a serving of grain, dairy or meat, and a vegetable in one meal. It was also easily mass produced and canned for easy meals and long-term storage.So President Woodrow and his kitchen staff served 2,000 soldiers who had returned from the war.It may be the case that many Americans eat ravioli on Veterans Day, but only because many Americans eat ravioli on every other day of the year as well, not because President Wilson once served it to some White House visitors.

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINIn a 12 September 2012 USA Today op-ed piece, David Green, the CEO and founder of the Hobby Lobby chain of arts-and-crafts stores, expressing his familyâ€™s opposition on religious grounds to a new government health mandate that required employers to provide insurance coverage to their employees for contraceptives:When my family and I started our company 40 years ago, we were working out of a garage on a $600 bank loan, assembling miniature picture frames. Our first retail store wasnâ€™t much bigger than most peopleâ€™s living rooms, but we had faith that we would succeed if we lived and worked according to Godâ€™s word. From there, Hobby Lobby has become one of the nationâ€™s largest arts and crafts retailers, with more than 500 locations in 41 states. Our children grew up into fine business leaders, and today we run Hobby Lobby together, as a family.Weâ€™re Christians, and we run our business on Christian principles. Iâ€™ve always said that the first two goals of our business are 1) to run our business in harmony with Godâ€™s laws, and 2) to focus on people more than money. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve tried to do. We close early so our employees can see their families at night. We keep our stores closed on Sundays, one of the weekâ€™s biggest shopping days, so that our workers and their families can enjoy a day of rest. We believe that it is by Godâ€™s grace that Hobby Lobby has endured, and he has blessed us and our employees. Weâ€™ve not only added jobs in a weak economy, weâ€™ve also raised wages for the past four years in a row. Our full-time employees start at 80% above minimum wage.But now, our government threatens to change all of that. A new government health care mandate says that our family business must provide what I believe are abortion-causing drugs as part of our health insurance. Being Christians, we donâ€™t pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means that we donâ€™t cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs. It goes against the biblical principles on which we have run this company since day one. If we refuse to comply, we could face $1.3 million per day in government fines.[Rest of article here.]Hobby Lobby filed a federal lawsuit challenging that mandate because it included such contraceptives as the morning-after pill and IUDs, which the plaintiffs considered to be forms of abortion:The lawsuit by the Oklahoma City-based chain claims the government mandate is forcing the companyâ€™s owners â€œto violate their deeply held religious beliefs under threat of heavy fines, penalties and lawsuits.â€ Failure to provide the drugs in the companyâ€™s health insurance plan could lead to fines of up to $1.3 million a day, the company said.â€œBy being required to make a choice between sacrificing our faith or paying millions of dollars in fines, we essentially must choose which poison pill to swallow,â€ David Green, Hobby Lobby CEO and founder, said in a statement. â€œWe simply cannot abandon our religious beliefs to comply with this mandate.â€The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Oklahoma City, alleges the Health and Human Services (HHS) mandate is unconstitutional and requests an injunction to prohibit it from being enforced. Hobby Lobby is self-insured and will be required to comply with the mandate by Jan. 1 [2013], the start of its health insurance plan year.Hobby Lobby is the largest and only non-Catholic-owned business to file a lawsuit against the Health and Human Services mandate that forces all companies, regardless of religious conviction, to provide coverage of drugs the lawsuit alleges are abortion-inducing, including the morning-after pill and week-after pill.â€œThe Green familyâ€™s religious beliefs forbid them from participating in, providing access to, paying for, training others to engage in, or otherwise supporting abortion-causing drugs and devices,â€ the lawsuit states.The lawsuit says the family also has â€œa sincere religious objectionâ€ to providing coverage for certain kinds of intrauterine devices and alleges they can cause the death of an embryo by preventing it from implanting in the wall of a womanâ€™s uterus.The morning-after pill works by preventing ovulation or fertilization. In medical terms, pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg attaches itself to the wall of the uterus. If taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it can reduce a womanâ€™s chances of pregnancy by as much as 89 percent.But critics of the contraceptive say it is the equivalent of an abortion pill because it can prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));The text of that piece was widely referenced online under misleading headlines such as â€œHobby Lobby May Close All 500+ Stores in 41 States,â€ based on the notion that David Green would shutter the entire chain rather than comply with the federal mandate, even though he neither announced nor threatened such a course of action (although he did vaguely suggest that the company might not be able to afford the potential financial penalties for refusing to comply with the mandate).The lawsuit finally played its way out in court in June 2014, when the Supreme Court ruled that closely held, for-profit companies (such as Hobby Lobby) could claim a religious exemption to the Affordable Care Act requirement that they provide health insurance coverage for contraceptives:The Supreme Court ruled that requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act violated a federal law protecting religious freedom.The 5-to-4 decision, which applied to two companies owned by Christian families, opened the door to challenges from other corporations to many laws that may be said to violate their religious liberty.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the courtâ€™s five more conservative justices, said a federal religious-freedom law applied to for-profit corporations controlled by religious families. He added that the requirement that the companies provide contraception coverage imposed a substantial burden on the companiesâ€™ religious liberty. He said the government could provide the coverage in other ways.Similar Hobby Lobby closure rumors circulated in mid-2017, after the chain was fined $3 million byFederal prosecutors over claims that the company had bought artifacts smuggled from Iraq that were deliberately mislabelled.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hobby-lobby/,"contraception, hobby lobby, obamacare",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseeval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_page_title-1000004','ezslot_0']));ORIGINIn August 2012, the business and technology worlds were rocked by a decision in a patent infringement lawsuit which had a jury finding that Samsung, the worldâ€™s largest maker of cell phones, had copied patented features of Appleâ€™s iPhone and iPad technologies in several of its products, and awarding Apple $1.05 billion in damages.Several days later, that decision was spoofed in a humor piece (translated from the original Spanish) positing that Samsung had paid off the award in nickels:Samsung Pays Apple $1 Billion Sending 30 Trucks Full of 5 Cents CoinsThis morning more than 30 trucks filled with 5-cent coins arrived at Appleâ€™s headquarters in California. Initially,  the security company that protects the facility said the trucks were in the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that  they will pay $1 billion dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way.The funny part is that the signed document does not specify a single payment method, so Samsung is entitled to send the creators of the iPhone their billion dollars in the way they deem best. Many readers who came across the article as it was circulated online mistook it for real news, even though the original  and its most common reproductions were labeled as â€œhumorâ€ and â€œsatire.â€  But even for those who encountered it out of context, several aspects of the story should have stood out as implausible:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3'])); The jury decision awarding Apple $1.05 billion in damages had been issued only a few days earlier, and damages as large as this are not paid off nearly so quickly.  The judge in the case had not yet handed down her decision, and undoubtedly several rounds of appeals (likely culminating in a settlement), dragging on for months (if not years), would take place before Samsung actually paid out any damages to Apple, as noted in the Washington Post:Q. Was the verdict final?A. No. Samsung is challenging it. First, Samsung will first ask the trial judge to toss the verdict. Then it will appeal to a court in Washington that specializes in patent appeals. Samsung has vowed to take the fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.(Indeed, a judge later found the jury had miscalculated $400 million in damages for 13 products and ordered a new trial to determine how much Samsung should pay.) To pay off a billion dollars in nickels would require 20 billion of those coins.  That amount would require Samsung to obtain the equivalent of all the nickels struck by the U.S. Mint in the last several decades.  (In 2011, for example, the U.S. Mint produced less than one billion nickels, and 2010 less than half a billion.)  Samsung would have to round up virtually every nickel in circulation to acquire over $1 billion worth of those coins, a feat that could hardly be accomplished without having a significant impact on the U.S. monetary system. A single nickel weights 5 grams (about .011 pounds), so a billion dollarsâ€™ worth of nickels would weigh in at about 110,000 tons.  That load would far exceed the carrying capacity of 30 or so trucks (requiring each truck to carry over 3,600 tons, or more than 7.2 million lbs. each). Even if the considerable weight of the trucks themselves werenâ€™t taken into account, the equivalent of about 2,755 eighteen-wheeler trucks, each hauling 40 tonsâ€™ worth of nickels, would be needed to transport the weight of that many coins (and even that calculation still doesnâ€™t take into account the volume of physical space needed to assemble, transport, and store 20 billion nickels).As to the hypothetical question of whether Apple would be obligated to accept payment of damages in such a form, since the late 19th century pennies and nickels have been considered legal tender and are therefore â€œa valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor.â€   (Businesses selling goods or services are not required by law to accept legal tender as payment, but this particular scenario involves payment of a debt rather than a purchase of goods or services.)",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-no-change-yet/,"apple, samsung",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINMessages about protecting your copyright or privacy rights on Facebook by posting a particular legal notice to your Facebook wall have been circulated on that social network for several years now, and all of them are variants of an older rumor holding that posting a similar notice on a web site would protect that siteâ€™s operators from prosecution for piracy:All your posts can become public tommorow . Even the messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. After all, it does not cost anything for a simple copy and paste.Better safe than sorry is right. Channel 13 News was just talking about this change in Facebookâ€™s privacy policy. Better safe than sorry.I do not give Facebook or any entities associated with Facebook permission to use my pictures, information, messages or posts, both past and future. By this statement, I give notice to Facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of privacy can be punished by law (UCC 1-308- 1 1 308-103 and the Rome Statute).NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates. DO NOT SHARE. You MUST copy and pasteIn both cases the claims were erroneous, an expression of the mistaken belief the use of some simple legal talisman â€” knowing enough to ask the right question or post a pertinent disclaimer â€” will immunize one from some undesirable legal consequence. The law just doesnâ€™t work that way.First off, the â€œproblemâ€ this ineffective solution supposedly addresses is a non-existent one: Facebook isnâ€™t claiming copyright to the personal information, photographs, and other material that their users are posting to the social network, nor have they announced any plans that would make all Facebook posts public (even previously deleted ones) regardless of a userâ€™s privacy settings):eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));In response to rumors about copyright issues that began circulating in November 2012 after Facebook announced they were considering revoking usersâ€™ rights to vote on proposed policy changes, the company issued a statement noting that:There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of usersâ€™ information or the content they post to the site. This is false. Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been. Click here to learn more: www.facebook.com/policies.Similarly, ABC News reported:[Users worried that] Facebook will own their photos or other media are posting [a frightful message] â€” unaware that it is a hoax. Hereâ€™s the truth: Facebook doesnâ€™t own your media.â€œWe have noticed some statements that suggest otherwise and we wanted to take a moment to remind you of the facts â€” when you post things like photos to Facebook, we do not own them,â€ Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement. â€œUnder our terms you grant Facebook permission to use, distribute, and share the things you post, subject to the terms and applicable privacy settings.â€Brad Shear, a Washington-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, said the message [that Facebook users are posting to their walls is] â€œmisleading and not true.â€ He said that when you agree to Facebookâ€™s terms of use you provide Facebook a â€œnon-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content you post. You do not need to make any declarations about copyright issues since the law already protects you. The privacy declaration [in this message] is worthless and does not mean anything.â€In any case, Facebook users cannot retroactively negate any of the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they signed up for their accounts, nor can they unilaterally alter or contradict any new privacy or copyright terms instituted by Facebook, simply by posting a contrary legal notice on their Facebook walls. Moreover, the fact that Facebook is now a publicly traded company (i.e., a company that has issued stocks which are traded on the open market) or an â€œopen capital entityâ€ has nothing to do with copyright protection or privacy rights. Any copyright or privacy agreements users of Facebook have entered into with that company prior to its becoming a publicly traded company or changing its policies remain in effect: they are neither diminished nor enhanced by Facebookâ€™s public status.Before you can use Facebook, you must indicate your acceptance of that social networkâ€™s legal terms, which includes its privacy policy and its terms and policies. You can neither alter your acceptance of that agreement nor restrict the rights of entities who are not parties to that agreement simply by posting a notice to your Facebook account, citing the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or referencing the Berne Convention. (One of the common legal talismans referenced above is UCC Section 1-308, which has long been popular among conspiracy buffs who incorrectly maintain that citing it above your signature on an instrument will confer upon you the ability to invoke extraordinary legal rights.)eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));If you do not agree with Facebookâ€™s stated policies, you have several options:Decline to sign up for a Facebook account.Bilaterally negotiate a modified policy with Facebook.Lobby for Facebook to amend its policies through its Facebook Site Governance section.Cancel your Facebook account.(Note that in the last case, you may have already ceded some rights which you cannot necessarily reclaim by canceling your account.)As techtalk noted of Facebook usersâ€™ current privacy rights:The fact is that Facebook members own the intellectual property (IP) that is uploaded to the social network, but depending on their privacy and applications settings, users grant the social network â€œa non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).â€Facebook adds, â€œ[t]his IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.â€While the social network does not technically own its members content, it has the right to use anything that is not protected with Facebookâ€™s privacy and applications settings.

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail, January 2012							There was a time in my life twenty years ago when I was driving a cab for a living. It was a cowboy'Â€Â™s life, a gamblers life, a life for someone who wanted no boss, constant movement, and the thrill of a dice roll every time a new passenger got into the cab.What I didn't count on when I took the job was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift, the car became a rolling confessional. Passengers would climb in, sit behind me in total darkness and anonymity, and tell me of their lives. We were like strangers on a train, the passengers and I, hurtling through the night, revealing intimacies we would never have dreamed of sharing during the brighter light of day.In those hours, I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh, and made me weep.  And none of those lives touched me more than that of a woman I picked up late on a warm August night. I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partyers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover or someone going off to an early shift at some factory in the industrial part of town.When I arrived at the address, the building was dark except for a single light in a ground-floor window. Under these circumstances many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a short minute, and then drive away. Too many bad possibilities awaited a driver who went up to a darkened building at two-thirty in the morning.But I had seen too many people trapped in a live of poverty who depended on the cab as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door to try to find the passenger. It might, I reasoned, be someone who needed my assistance. Would I not want a driver to do the same if my mother or father had called for a cab? So I walked to the door and knocked.""Just a minute"", answered a frail and elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman, somewhere in her eighties, stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like you might see in a costume shop or a Goodwill store or in a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The sound had been her dragging it across the floor.The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.""Would you carry my bag out to the car?"" she said. ""I'd like a few moments alone. Then, if you could come back and help me? I'm not very strong.""I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm, and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. ""It's nothing"", I told her. ""I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated"". ""Oh, you're such a good boy"", she said. Her praise and appreciation were almost embarrassing.When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, and then asked, ""Could you drive through downtown?""""It's not the shortest way,"" I answered. ""Oh, I don't mind,"" she said. ""I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice"".I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. ""I don't have any family left,"" she continued. ""The doctor said I should go there. He says I don't have very long."" I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. ""What route would you like me to go?"" I asked.For the next two hours we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they had first been married. She made me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she would have me slow down in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, ""I'm tired. Let's go now.""We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a tar driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. Without waiting for me, they opened the door and began assisting the woman. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her: perhaps she had phone them right before we left.I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase up to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. ""How much do I owe you?"" she asked, reaching into her purse. ""Nothing,"" I said.""You have to make a living,"" she answered. ""There are other passengers,"" I responded. Almost without thinking, I bent over and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. ""You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,"" she said. ""Thank you."" There was nothing more to say. I squeezed her hand once, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me I could hear the door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.I did not pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the remainder of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten a driver who had been angry or abusive or impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run or had honked once, then driven away? What if I had been in a foul mood and had refused to engage the woman in conversation? How many other moments like that had I missed or failed to grasp?We are so conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unawares. When that woman hugged me and said that I had brought her a moment of joy, it was possible to believe  that I had been placed on earth for the sole purpose of providing her with that last ride. I do not think that I have done anything in my life that was any more important. 						LegendRATINGLegendORIGINThis piece about a cab driverâ€™s giving an elderly woman a ride to a hospice has been reprinted in a number of books and widely circulated on the Internet since  1999, typically without attribution and under varying titles such as â€œThe Cab Ride,â€ â€œThe Cab Driver,â€ and â€œThe Taxi Driver.â€ It was penned by author Kent Nerburn and was originally published under the title â€œAnd where there is sadness, joyâ€ in his 1999 book Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace.In 2008, Kent Nerburn posted an entry on his blog in response to the Internet-prompted popularity of this item:A website out of the U.K. has recently posted the now well-traveled story of my experience as a cab driver, when I picked up an old woman who was on her way to a hospice. It has reached number one on a number of websites as a result.I am thrilled when my ordinary life offers up an extraordinary moment that brings some solace or insight or enjoyment to others, and such has been the good fortune of that moment in the late 1980â€™s when I was driving the â€œÂ€Âœdog shiftâ€Â€Â in Minneapolis, Minnesota. What is noteworthy about that moment, beyond itâ€™Â™s poignancy, is that I did not create it; I merely experienced it and let it unfold.Life gives us all such moments â€” I call them â€œÂ€ÂœBlue Momentsâ€Â€Â â€” where a brilliant light shines through the ordinary moments in our ordinary days. They come unsolicited and unannounced, and provide us the gift of significance and, if we are lucky, the opportunity to serve.What it is important is to remember that these ARE gifts, and that we cannot receive them if we are not open to them. We need to listen closely, watch closely, and take care not to rush past or through them when they arrive. They are the fabric of our lives, and they will weave themselves with complexity and beauty if we give them time to do so.Given the only witness to the events Nerburn described in his tale is unidentified and long dead, whether this account describes a real-life incident cannot be independently verified.",legend,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-cab-ride/,0,snopes,us,,,,

UnprovenRATINGUnproveneval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_page_title-1000003','ezslot_0']));ORIGINIf various rock â€˜nâ€™ roll memoirs are to be believed, nearly every American musical group of the 1960s had at least one member who evaded the Vietnam-era draft by scheming to fail a physical examination through some combination of drug use, sleep deprivation, neglected hygiene, deliberate starvation, feigned homosexuality, and assumed bizarre behavior.  Johnny Roganâ€™s biography of the Byrds, for example, describes such plotting by two of the groupâ€™s members, frontman Gene Clark and drummer Michael Clarke:Gene had previous escaped [the draft] due to a knee injury incurred when he played football in his teens.  But the diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatters disease was remedied by rest and physiotherapy, so it was not long before he was re-examined. This time, he feigned madness, employing whatever drugs were at his disposal to enhance the desired effects.  â€œGene was living with me at the time,â€ Clarke told me. â€œWe did a programme and it was hard getting Gene out of the draft. They werenâ€™t buying that bullshit about his leg. I kept him up for a week. Thanks to massive amounts of dexedrine he screwed up all the tests. They looked up his ass. It was seriously demeaning. But we were the best of brothers and I helped get him out.â€â€œWhen I went in, it was major shit. I wore these stupid pants and sandals. I sat there cross-legged and suggested I had a problem. They were waiting for somebody to try and get out and their attitude was â€˜Youâ€™re front line, dude.â€™ I got through the tests. There was a form with the question, â€˜Are you a homosexual?â€™ I wrote â€˜No!â€™, then changed it to â€˜Yesâ€™, then â€˜Noâ€™ again, then crossed it out a few times. I knew all the answers and freaked out. I followed the yellow line and I had to take a piss. They give you this thing to carry and I threw it down on the floor and went over in the corner and took a piss. The guy said, â€˜This is very serious â€¦ You canâ€™t do that!â€™ I turned around and accidentally ended up pissing on him. Then somebody tried to take my stuff, so I jumped in and said, â€˜Take your hands off my stuff or Iâ€™ll kill you. Iâ€™m seriousâ€™ Iâ€™d got my hands round this guyâ€™s neck. Right away, they sent me to the psychiatristâ€™s office. They were looking at me thinking, â€˜Is he for real or is he bullshitting us?â€™ There was one guy there with long hair who went to Vietnam, but I didnâ€™t. You had to be good. The psychiatrist asked me, â€˜Have you ever done it with a woman?â€™ I said, â€˜No!â€™ He said, â€˜Have you ever wanted to?â€™ I said, â€˜No!â€™ He said, â€˜Have you ever done it with a man?â€™ I said, â€˜No!â€™ He was just looking at me â€” thatâ€™s all he was doing. Finally, he said, â€˜Get the hell out of here.â€™ They ran me down the red line and booted my ass out of there â€” â€˜Get out of here, you faggot bastard, schizoid homosexual, not fit for military service at any time â€” 4-F.â€™ I ran out the door, jumped in my Porsche, beat it back to the beach and was laughing all the way. If you think I wanted to go to Vietnam, you were out of your mind. I was making too much goddamn money.â€In an interview with published by High Times magazine in 1977, Ted Nugent claimed he had engaged in similar behavior to deliberately fail a physical exam in 1967 and be qualified 4-F (not acceptable for military service):Interviewer: How did you get out of the draft?Ted Nugent: Ted was a young boy, appearing to be a hippie but quite opposite in fact, working hard and playing hard, playing rock and roll like a deviant. People would question my sanity, I played so much. So I got my notice to be in the draft. Do you think I was gonna lay down my guitar and go play army? Give me a break! I was busy doinâ€™ it to it. I had a career Jack. If I was walkinâ€™ around, hippying down, gettingâ€™ loaded and pickinâ€™ my ass like your common curs, Iâ€™d say â€œHey yeah, go in the army. Beats the poop out of scuffinâ€™ around in the gutters.â€ But I wasnâ€™t a gutter dog. I was a hard workinâ€™, mother****inâ€™ rock and roll musician.I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavinâ€™ and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettinâ€™ kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Iâ€™d drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up.See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workinâ€™ dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces. Iâ€™m gonna play their own game, and Iâ€™m gonna destroy â€™em. Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss. I was ill. And three or four days before, I started stayinâ€™ awake. I was close to death, but I was in control. I was extremely antidrug as Iâ€™ve always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine. Talk about one wounded motherf*cker. A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didnâ€™t know and Iâ€™m vacuuming that poop right up. I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop. I was six-foot-three of sin. So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught. I was not a good person. I was wounded. But as painful and nauseous as it was â€” â€™cause I was really into beinâ€™ clean and on the ball â€” I made gutter swine hippies look like football players. I was deviano.So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldnâ€™t believe the smell. They were ridiculinâ€™ me and pushinâ€™ me around and I was cryinâ€™, but all the time I was laughinâ€™ to myself. When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall. Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, â€œOh my God, put those back on! You f*cking swine you!â€ Then they had a urine test and I couldnâ€™t piss, But my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter. I had poop on my hand and my arm. The guy almost puked. I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat. The last thing I remember was wakinâ€™ up in the ear test booth and they were sweepinâ€™ up. So I went home and cleaned up.They took a putty knife to me. I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk. A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass. And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F. Theyâ€™d call dead people before theyâ€™d call my ass. But you know the funny thing about it? Iâ€™d make an incredible army man. Iâ€™d be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and Iâ€™d have the baddest bunch of motherf*ckinâ€™ killers youâ€™d ever seen in my platoon. But I just wasnâ€™t into it. I was too busy doinâ€™ my own thing, you know?eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Questioned about that account some thirty years later (by which time Nugent was known as a staunch political conservative, a supporter of the Republican Party, and an advocate of hunting and gun ownership rights) in an interview with the UKâ€™s Independent newspaper, Nugent disclaimed that previous account of his draft-evading activities as story he had made up and fed to a gullible High Times reporter and asserted that he actually had avoided the draft through the legitimate means of a student deferment:He has the rage, but he doesnâ€™t have the war record. At 18, he was called up to serve in Vietnam. â€œIn 1977 you gave an interview to High Times [the cannabis userâ€™s journal of record] where you claimed you defecated in your clothes to avoid the draft.â€â€œI never shit my pants to get out of the draft,â€ says Nugent, good-naturedly.â€œYou also told them you took crystal meth before the medical â€” as a result of which, and I quote: â€˜I got this big juicy 4F.'â€â€œUnbelievable. Meth,â€ he replies, in a tone of deep sarcasm. â€œYes, thatâ€™s my drug of choice. Youâ€™ve got to realise that these interviewers would arrive with glazed eyes and I would make stories up. I never did crystal meth. And I never pooped my pants.â€â€œBut you did dodge the draft.â€ â€œI had a 1Y [student deferment]. I enrolled at Oakland Community College.â€â€œYou said then that you wanted â€˜to teach the stupid bastards in the military a lessonâ€™. Iâ€™d have thought youâ€™d have loved the army. Guns. Travel. Danger.â€â€œBack then, I didnâ€™t even understand what World War II was.â€â€œSo basically,â€ â€” I admit that I have, unaccountably, started to speak Nugent â€” â€œyou didnâ€™t want to get your Michigan ass blown off in Vietnam.â€ â€œCorrect. I did not want to get my ass blown off in Vietnam.â€Clearly, though, Ted Nugent didnâ€™t make up the tale about his snorting crystal meth before his pre-induction physical as a one-off jape just to fool a High Times reporter, as he said the same thing in an interview with CREEM magazine:Q: â€œAre you still a hard case on drugs?â€A: â€œReal hard. I have never done a drug in my life. I have never smoked a joint in my life. I took two tokes off a joint with the MC5 one night and almost gagged and thought it was stupid. And thatâ€™s it. I took two tokes off a joint once. I snorted one line of cocaine. And one line of crystal methedrine before my draft physical â€” but God, that was worth it because I wanted to see the look on the Sergeantâ€™s face. Thatâ€™s it for drugs.â€An analysis of Ted Nugentâ€™s Selective Service classification record doesnâ€™t prove or disprove either version of the story. He did indeed receive a high school student deferment (1-S) in 1967 and then (as he stated) a college student deferment (2-S) in 1968.  However, he was reclassified as â€œavailable for military serviceâ€ (1-A) in 1969 and then subsequently rejected as a result of a physical examination and given a 1-Y classification.  (The 1-Y classification denoted persons â€œqualified for service only in time of war or national emergencyâ€ and was generally assigned to registrants who had exhibited medical conditions that were limiting but not disabling.)  After the 1-Y classification was eliminated by the Selective Service at the end of 1971, Nugent was reclassified as 4-F (â€œregistrant not qualified for any military serviceâ€).So, Ted Nugent did have a student deferment for part of the time he was eligible for the Vietnam-era draft, but he also did fail a physical examination and receive a medical exemption (which, as far as we know, he has neither acknowledged nor explained).  But in the absence of more specific information about the results of that physical examination and the reasons for his medical exemption, it cannot be ascertained how truthful the account Nugent gave to High Times magazine back in 1977 might be.  (Ted Nugentâ€™s press representative did not respond to a request for additional information about this subject.)

He lifted the nation's spirits when, as one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, he was blasted alone into orbit around the Earth; the enduring affection for him is so powerful that even now people find themselves misting up at the sight of his face or the sound of his voice.But for all these years, Glenn has had a hero of his own, someone who he has seen display endless courage of a different kind:Annie Glenn.They have been married for 68 years.He is 90; she turned 92 on Friday.This weekend there has been news coverage of the 50th anniversary of Glenn's flight into orbit. We are being reminded that, half a century down the line, he remains America's unforgettable hero.He has never really bought that.Because the heroism he most cherishes is of a sort that is seldom cheered. It belongs to the person he has known longer than he has known anyone else in the world.[Rest of article here.]						TrueRATINGTrueORIGINMost Americans are familiar with the exploits of John Glenn, a former U.S. Marine Corps pilot who, as one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, was transformed into a national hero after becoming the first American to orbit the Earth on 20 February 1962. Later in life he represented Ohio in the United States Senate for twenty-four years, and in 1998 he became the oldest person to go into space when he flew on a Space Shuttle Discovery mission in 1998.Much less well known is John Glennâ€™s wife, the former Annie Castor, whom Glenn had known since childhood and married when he was a 21-year-old combat pilot during World War II. In February 2012, the fiftieth anniversary of Glennâ€™s orbital flight prompted CNN contributor Bob Greene to pen the article referenced above about the Glennsâ€™ lengthy marriage (currently 68 years) and Annieâ€™s long battle to overcome a terrible stuttering problem which had she had struggled with since she was a little girl, an affliction she finally managed to overcome at the age of 53. Annie Glenn began speaking out publicly about her lifelong struggle with her speech impediment in the early 1980s, discussing the subject on national television and in the press, crowning her achievement by making speeches on behalf of her husband as he campaigned for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination.A 1982 Los Angeles Times article on the subject of Annie Glennâ€™s speaking out about her disability reported that:Annie Glenn is one of the countryâ€™s estimated 2 million people who suffer what may be the most misunderstood disability: stuttering.Until she underwent a new form of intensive, live-in treatment three years ago at the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., Mrs. Glenn could not speak well enough to call the plumber, order a meal in a restaurant or go by herself with her injured child to a hospital emergency room, much less give a campaign speech for her husband.Although she still stutters slightly and speaks haltingly, Mrs. Glenn can perform all those once impossible tasks. She even gives campaign speeches, maybe not with as much polish as other wives, but certainly with more pluck.At a private athletic club in Cleveland, 150 people attending the annual meeting of the Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center sat in silent attention at their dinner tables as their speaker told them something really quite remarkable.â€œFor the first time in my life,â€ said Annie Glenn, age 62, â€œI can carry on a conversation.â€It wasnâ€™t so long ago that Mrs. Glenn, classified as an 85% stutterer, would have found it impossible, even, to travel by airplane from Washington to Cleveland by herself unless she wrote down what she wanted for the airline employee at the ticket counter. She told the audience of such an experience and how the men wrote notes back, thinking she was deaf.During the slow, agonizing process in which stutterers try to force out sounds, often with their hearts beating at an accelerated rate, their palms sweating, their cheeks blushing and their heads bobbing, Mrs. Glenn has been laughed at. Store clerks have reacted by pointing an index finger at the head and moving it in circles (the â€œcrazyâ€ sign), or by asking if she were cold when her jaw would quiver, or saying quite simply, â€œLady, I havenâ€™t got all day.â€Sometimes Mrs. Glenn would walk away rather than continue the ordeal of shopping.Her husband had to make all the telephone calls to repairmen and friends. Her neighbors had to call the doctor when her children became ill and go to the hospital with her to talk with the doctors.Mrs. Glenn had undergone several traditional speech therapies but experienced little or no improvement until she enrolled herself for two different sessions at the Hollins Institute, most recently in September of 1978. The therapy lasts 11 hours a day for three weeks.After taking the therapy twice, Mrs. Glenn still sees a therapist twice a month at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, and she practices every day â€” on the telephone. She makes several calls every morning. There is a sign next to her phone at home that says â€œTake a full breath, relax your throat, keep the sound moving.â€â€œShe talks to her buddies all over the world,â€ John Glenn said, pretending to resent the phone bills. â€œThis is a dramatic, new life for her.â€eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));A 1983 Associated Press article on the same subject read (in part):For 53 of her 63 years, Annie Glenn was a prisoner of her own tongue, a stutterer who tripped over eight out of every 10 words, relying on facial expressions to make a point. She disciplined her two children, she recalls, â€œwith my eyes and my hand.â€Today, the wife of Ohio Sen. John Glenn has broken through a sound barrier. â€œBeing able to talk to people is something I could never do,â€ she says. â€œMy life is like a dream.â€In numerous conversations [on the campaign trail] throughout a day that started before dawn and ended long after sunset, [the couple] talked about Mrs. Glennâ€™s newly acquired ability to speak fluently and the impact of her lifetime of stuttering on their marriage, children and career.â€œJohn would make all my telephone calls,â€ Mrs. Glenn says, shooting a stern look at her husband as he reached for a third chocolate bar. â€œI would try to go shopping but couldnâ€™t ask the clerk what I wanted, so I would hunt and hunt. A lot of the time Iâ€™d go out of the store empty-handed because I couldnâ€™t find what I wanted.â€It was in 1974, after Mrs. Glenn enrolled in a speech program at Hollins College near Roanoke, Va., that her speech improved noticeably. But she didnâ€™t keep up the daily therapy sessions or return for refresher courses, and she regressed.After a second session at Hollins and a program of daily therapy, Mrs. Glenn is making speeches.â€œAnnie was never silent to me,â€ [Glenn] says. â€œBut to see her at this age branch out to things she was interested in but could never participate in â€¦â€",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/annie-glenn/,ASP Article,snopes,us,,,,

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail, May 2011							I've heard a lot lately about using fetus stem cells for certain things. But as a flavor enhancer? In Pepsi?? I find that hard to believe. Is there any truth that Pepsi is using aborted fetus to research flavor enhancers?						FalseRATINGFalseeval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-under_page_title-1000003','ezslot_1']));ORIGINIn April 2015, the quack web site Natural News rebeat the drum of a several-year-old contoversy by publishing a misleading article (which was republished by a number of other equally disreputable web sites) holding that major food companies such as Pepsico sell products â€œmanufactured using the tissue of aborted human babiesâ€:Every time you purchase mass-produced processed â€œfoodâ€ from the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, or Nestle, youâ€™re choosing, whether you realize it or not, to feed your family not only genetically engineered poisons and chemical additives, but also various flavoring agents manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies.Itâ€™s true: A company based out of California, known as Senomyx, is in the business of using aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals, both savory and sweet, which are then added to things like soft drinks, candy and cookies. And Senomyx has admittedly partnered with a number of major food manufacturers to lace its cannibalistic additives into all sorts of factory foods scarfed down by millions of American consumers every single day.In order to debunk that claim, we need first provide a couple of definitions: Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, commonly known as HEK 293, are a specific cell line which, as the name denotes, were derived from the kidney cells of an aborted human embryo in 1972. This cell line is widely used in efforts such as cell biology research and biotechnology/pharmaceutical development. Senomyx is a U.S.-based biotechnology company focused on â€œdiscovering and developing innovative flavor ingredients for the food, beverage, and ingredient supply industries,â€ primarily additives that amplify certain flavors and smells in foodseval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_2']));A controversy over Senomyx originated with the pro-life organization Children of God for Life back in March 2011, which maintained that Senomyx used HEK 293 in its flavor ingredient development efforts (citing a 2002 paper by company researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences as evidence). That organization called for a boycott of major food companies (including Nestle, Campbellâ€™s Soup, Kraft Foods, and PepsiCo) that had partnered with Senomyx:Senomyx website states that â€œThe companyâ€™s key flavor programs focus on the discovery and development of savory, sweet and salt flavor ingredients that are intended to allow for the reduction of MSG, sugar and salt in food and beverage products â€¦ Using isolated human taste receptors, we created proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems that provide a biochemical or electronic readout when a flavor ingredient interacts with the receptor.â€ Senomyx notes their collaborators provide them research and development funding plus royalties on sales of products using their flavor ingredients.â€œWhat they do not tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 â€” human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors,â€ stated Debi Vinnedge, Executive Director for Children of God for Life, a pro-life watch dog group that has been monitoring the use of aborted fetal material in medical products and cosmetics for years.â€œThey could have easily chosen COS (monkey) cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, insect cells or other morally obtained human cells expressing the G protein for taste receptors,â€ Vinnedge added.Itâ€™s important to note here that â€” whatever one might think of fetal stem cell research in general, and regardless of whether or not Senomyx uses HEK 293-derived cells in its development efforts â€” neither Pepsi nor any other U.S. food company is actually manufacturing or selling any consumable products â€œthat are actually made using the cell tissue of unborn babies that were murdered through abortion.â€  What weâ€™re talking about here is a cell line derived from a single (healthy, aborted) fetus over forty years ago: claiming that current food products employing flavorings derived from research based on the HEK 293 cell line â€œare actually made using the cell tissue of unborn babiesâ€ is like saying that possessing a digitized image of a photocopy of a picture of a Beethoven manuscript is the same as â€œowning a document in Beethovenâ€™s own handwritingâ€ â€” the original is not present in substance, only in a multi-generational, representational form.  CBS News noted such in a mid-2011 report on the  Senomyx controversy (which for some reason primarily focused on PepsiCo):[Senomyx] appears to be engineering HEK cells to function like the taste-receptor cells we have in our mouth. This way, Senomyx can test millions of substances to see if they work as different types of taste enhancers without subjecting human volunteers to endless taste tests.To non-scientists this may sound a bit strange, but the reality is that HEK 293 cells are widely used in pharmaceutical research, helping scientists create vaccines as well as drugs like those for rheumatoid arthritis. The difference here is that Senomyxâ€™s work for Pepsi is one of the first times the cells have (potentially) been used to create a food or beverage. (And itâ€™s important to note that no part of a human kidney cell are ever a part of Senomyxâ€™s taste enhancers or any finished food products.)For Debi Vinnedge, who runs the anti-abortion group Children of God for Life, that doesnâ€™t matter. â€œItâ€™s the eeew factor. It strikes a really strong reaction in people,â€ she said in an interview. Even though HEK 293 cells trace their origin to a single fetal kidney back in the 1970s â€” everything since has come from cultured cell lines â€” Vinnedge considers their use unethical because it indirectly creates a market for aborted fetuses and encourages scientists to hunt for new embryonic cell lines. She argues that Senomyx could use other, non-fetus-based cell lines, such as those from animals.Science and medicine writer Matthew Herper offered a similar explanation in Forbes:The fetus-derived cell line weâ€™re talking about was created around the time I was born. This is 35-year-old technology. And it is widely used in cell biology. And there is no way youâ€™ll consume them or that the cells would cause any health problems.The cells, called HEK 293 cells (that stands for human embryonic kidney) were taken from an aborted fetus in the 1970s in the Netherlands. Bits of chopped up DNA from the adenovirus, a virus that causes a pretty severe cold. The kidney cells were forced to take up bits of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 that used a calcium solution. The resulting cells donâ€™t act much like human cells at all, but they are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re used in the development of drugs and vaccines. No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isnâ€™t leading to new abortions.A tiny company called Senomyx has been working to use this new technology to create food additives. Senomyx has isolated receptors found on cells that detect taste, and added them to the HEK cells. This allows them to test thousands of potential taste additives to see whether they might taste sweet or savory with a speed that would be impossible with human taste testers.  Synomyx has announced collaborations with Pepsi, Nestle, and Coca-Cola.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_6']));Senomyx themselves were circumspect about publicly addressing the issue of their whether they actually used the HEK 293 cell line in their research, although reporters investigating the subject noted references to  HEK 293 in the companyâ€™s patents.  For example, Laine Doss wrote in the Miami New Times that:Asked about the [Children of God for Lifeâ€™s] action alert, Gwen Rosenberg, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications for Senomyx, said, â€œWe donâ€™t discuss details of our research, but you wonâ€™t find anything on our website about HEK293.â€ I asked Rosenberg if Senomyx had a position on stem cell research. â€œWeâ€™ve never been asked that,â€ she replied, â€œWe donâ€™t have a position on anything. Weâ€™re dedicated to finding new flavors to reduce sugars and reduce salt. Our focus is to help consumers with diabetes or high blood pressure have a better quality of life.â€Though Rosenberg states there is nothing on the company website linking Senomyx with HEK293, a little Googling turned up a patent issued in 2008 for â€œRecombinant Methods for Expressing a Functional Sweet Taste Receptor,â€ in which a line item mentions HEK293.And Melanie Warner wrote for CBS News that:Is this claim true? Neither Pepsi nor Senomyx returned calls, so we donâ€™t know the companiesâ€™ side of the story. But a perusal of Senomyxâ€™s patents suggests that it may well be. All but 7 of the companyâ€™s 77 patents refer to the use of HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells, which researchers have used for decades as biological workhorses.In 2010 Senomyx entered into a four-year collaborative agreement to develop sweet enhancers and natural high-potency sweeteners for PepsiCo beverages, but itâ€™s unclear whether PepsiCo has ever marketed any food products that include additives (of any kind) developed by Senomyx. It wasnâ€™t until March 2014 that Senomyx announced the first fruits of their partnership with PepsiCo, a sweetness-enhancing â€œflavor modifierâ€ known as Sweetmyx, but weâ€™ve seen no subsequent announcement that PepsiCo has begun using Sweetmyx, and that additive appears to be a purely synthetic one:Q: How exactly does Sweetmyx work?A: Our tongueâ€™s taste receptors work somewhat like pieces of a puzzle. When sugar hits our tongue a molecule of it will connect with a sweet taste receptor, stimulating the nerve pathway and creating the sensation of sweet. Sweetmyx hijacks that pathway by agitating and exciting that sweet taste receptor with another chemical that works when itâ€™s in the presence of sugar. So in a way, it increases your receptorâ€™s sensitivity to sweet taste sensations.Q: Is Sweetmyx natural?A: Although Senomyx has both â€œnaturalâ€ and artificial flavoring additives in their pipeline, from what Iâ€™ve been able to surmise, S617 (the companyâ€™s moniker for Sweetmyx) is not a naturally derived sweetness enhancer. It appears to be artificially synthesized from chemicals.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content-1000002','ezslot_7']));Pepsiâ€™s official response to the Senomyx issue was to point inquirers to their Responsible Research Statement, which stated that â€œPepsiCoâ€™s research processes and those of our partners are confidential for competitive reasons. However, PepsiCo does not conduct or fund research that utilizes any human tissue or cell lines derived from human embryos.â€  We contacted the Media Relations department at PepsiCo and posed some specific questions to them about their relationship with Senomyx but received only non-specific answers in response:PepsiCo has a relationship with Senomyx to help us reduce sugar in future products. Senomyx does not provide ingredients to PepsiCo, nor does it manufacture PepsiCo products.Senomyx is required to abide by our responsible research statement for any work they conduct for PepsiCo. As with each of our research partners, Senomyx is also required to meet all relevant industry and government regulatory standards in the work it performs for PepsiCo. We canâ€™t speak on behalf of another company or address speculation about work involving other companies.Senomyx did not respond to our request for information.

UnprovenRATINGUnprovenORIGINAlzheimerâ€™s disease is an incurable and terminal form of dementia that afflicts millions of sufferers worldwide. While some Alzheimerâ€™s patients live more than a decade after being diagnosed, life expectancy from the onset of noticeable symptoms is usually 7 years. There are no available treatments that halt or reverse the progression of the disease.Â The cause of Alzheimerâ€™s is unknown, although theories abound. SomeÂ evidenceÂ suggests that one cause could be related to lack of glucose metabolism in certain parts of the brain, asÂ describedÂ in a 2014 case study published inÂ Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience:The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body, and under most conditions, relies almost exclusively on glucose for its energy needs. Using [a chemical tracer], the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) can be measured.

Ketones can also be used as a source of energy for the brain (a process called ketosis) and there are at least some suggestions that ketones can help pick up the slack in a glucose-deprived brain suffering from Alzheimerâ€™s.Â A 2014Â studyÂ published inÂ Neurobiology AgingÂ compared the cognitive effects of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s after being treated with either a single dose of a specific chain fatty acid found in coconut oil, or a placebo:A single 40â€‰g dose of [caprylic triglyceride, a fatty acid] induced mild ketosis and a significant positive correlation between performance on [a] paragraph recall task and [concentrations of ketones in the blood] was found.The scientific research in this area is in its infancy, and claims that coconut oil specifically, or ketosis in general, can play a role in ameliorating the affects of Alzheimerâ€™s disease require more research.Â ",unproven,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coconut-oil/,"ASP Article, Disease",snopes,us,,,,

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINMonday night 11/14/2011 at Lambeau FieldThis is what ESPN failed to show you Monday night, 11/14/2011.Apparently, they thought their commercials were more important than showing this scene for about 5 seconds.On the evening of 14 November 2011, the NFLâ€™s Green Bay Packers hosted the Minnesota Vikings in a football match-up held at Lambeau Field in Green Bay which was televised by ESPN as part of that networkâ€™s Monday Night Football schedule.  As the previous Friday (11 November) had been Veterans Day, the Packers announced they would be staging a number of Veterans Day-themed events before the game and during halftime:The Green Bay Packersâ€™ Monday night game against the Minnesota Vikings is dedicated to showing appreciation to the U.S. Military through a variety of activities in recognition of Veteranâ€™s Day.Upon entering Lambeau Field fans will receive an American flag, compliments of the Wisconsin Army National Guard and Oshkosh Defense. Attendees will also take part in an in-stadium USAA card stunt to thank veterans and current military for their service.The USO of Wisconsin will be standing by with Oshkosh Defense in the parking lot to accept phone cards for the military. People can drop off phone calling cards to the USO reps at the Oshkosh Defense M-ATV, or can donate cash to be used to purchase cards for their â€œOperation Phone Homeâ€ efforts. If bringing cards, people are encouraged to get international cards, which provide the most reliable service for the military members.Other military-themed activities scheduled include a large on-field flag with stars representing all military branches during the national anthem, military shout-outs on TundraVision, and a halftime show featuring the Wisconsin National Guard 132nd Army Band and fireworks display.The Packers and WPS will also be recognizing and welcoming home 1st Lieutenant Infantry Officer Kent Gavin through Operation Fan Mail on-field prior to the national anthem. Gavin will be accompanied by his fiancÃ©e and her parents.The national anthem will be performed by Steel Magnoliaâ€™s Meghan Linsey and Joshua Scott Jones.Some of those activities, such as the pre-game card stunts in which the stadium crowd spelled out messages including â€œThank You Veteransâ€ and â€œThank You Militaryâ€ and the unfurling of a large flag on the field during the playing of the national anthem, were captured in the photographs displayed above and audience videos such as the following:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Within days of the game, reports (such as the following account from Milwaukee television station WTMJ) began to trickle out expressing disappointment that only spectators present at the game had been able to view the pre-game Veterans Day tribute activities at Lambeau Field, as ESPN did not include them in their telecast:Packers fans inside Lambeau Field had a chance to take part in a special moment to honor Americaâ€™s veterans before the Packers-Vikings game Monday night.Most of them raised a card to help form a pattern that said â€œThank You Veteransâ€ and American flags.However, most of the nation did not see the tribute, as ESPN-TV was taking a commercial break during the national anthem.We contacted ESPN to invite them to explain the circumstances behind why the tribute had not been aired, and they sent us the following response:We appreciate and applaud these entertainers for their hard work and talent, but exposure of them before games and at halftime canâ€™t be guaranteed.

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINIn December 2008, two-year-old Caylee Marie Anthony was reported missing from her Orlando, Florida, home. Suspicion fell upon her 22-year-old mother, Casey Anthony, who in the aftermath of her daughterâ€™s disappearance gave conflicting statements to police.The childâ€™s remains were discovered in December 2008 in a wooded area near the family residence. Casey Anthony was arrested and tried for the toddlerâ€™s murder, and in July 2011, in a case that captivated the nation, she was found not guilty.  Anthony is currently serving out her probation (she was convicted on four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer) in an undisclosed location in Florida. Many believe the accused got away with murder. The notion, therefore, that someone like Casey Anthony would again look to become a mother (thereby placing yet another child at risk) is unconscionable.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));It is upon this sense of revulsion that a Weekly World News article played. The online tabloidâ€™s 16 November 2011 article, entitled â€œCasey Anthony Adopts a Baby,â€ contained this especially horrifying nugget: â€œCasey Anthony wants to prove to the world that she is a good mother and told corrections officers in the Orange County Jail that she plans on adopting 3-4 babies and having 3-4 of her own.â€  Mercifully, the story was not real. There was no at-risk Romanian child on the brink of being handed over to the suspected child killer. The  Weekly World News (WWN) web site is the online successor to the popular entertainment tabloid of the same name. Its stock in trade is fantastically fictional headlines stories such as â€œAlien Spaceships to Attack Earth in 2011â€ and â€œGeorge Clooney Running for President.â€In March 2013, the Weekly World News followed up a (false) rumor that Anthony was pregnant by publishing another fantastically fictional article asserting that not only was she with child, but that the father was â€œa high profile man that everyone in America would know,â€ that Casey was expecting twins, and that she was planning to name one of the children Caylee in honor of her deceased daughter.The same fakery appeared in August 2014 when the fake news site National Report built upon the â€œpregnant with twinsâ€ rumor, adding a separate twist in yet another spoof article. In that version, Anthony was not procreating with an unnamed notable fellow, but angling to re-enter the public sphere by landing a reality TV show. Anthonyâ€™s goal, the article claimed, was public redemption:â€œShe wants to redeem herself in the eyes of America,â€ stated Nieven. â€œDid she make mistakes? Absolutely! But this is the U.S.A., everyone can get a second chance here. And letâ€™s not forget that Casey was found innocent of the charges against her. She was released. She is a free woman now, and this show is going to allow her to make a great life for her new little angels.â€However, that the WWN and National Report pieces about Casey Anthony were spoofs didnâ€™t mean the real Casey Anthony had forsworn all thoughts of trying  motherhood again. In one of her jailhouse letters (which were released to the general public in July 2011), she wrote, â€œI had a dream not too long ago that I was pregnant. It was like having Cays all over again. Iâ€™ve thought about adopting, which even sounds weird to me saying it, but there are so many children that deserve to be loved.â€ ",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anthony-not-adverse/,"casey anthony, Important If True",snopes,us,,,,

Allen, 55, of Oakton, Virginia, was sentenced to 40 months in prison after being convicted of fraud for participating in a $2.9 billion scheme that caused the mortgage and lending firmÂ Taylor, Bean & Whitaker to go under. Two years earlier, Roy Brown, 54, a homeless African-American man, was sentenced to 15 years without the possibility of parole for robbing a bank in Shreveport, Louisiana. According to the scant reporting on the story, Brown only took $100 from the stack handed to him and told the teller he needed it because he was homeless and hungry.The two stories, of a CEO given a relatively lenient sentence for his involvement in a multi-billion dollar fraud scheme versus the homeless man who only took $100 from a bank, were comparedÂ â€” albeit with little detail:The story of 54-year-old Roy Brown, a homeless man who couldnâ€™t afford to pay basic food and shelter expenses, is heartbreakingly cruel: A homeless man robbed a Louisiana bank and took a $100 bill. After feeling remorseful, he surrendered to police the next day. The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison.The day after this story appeared, prosecutors celebrated the fact that they were able to get a 40-month prison sentence for investment tycoon Paul R. Allen, who defrauded lenders of more than $3 billion.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));There seems to be only oneÂ news accountÂ documenting the incident that landed Brown in prison:A homeless man robbed a Louisiana bank and took a $100 bill. After feeling remorseful, he surrendered to police the next day. The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison.Roy Brown, 54, robbed the Capital One bank in Shreveport, Louisiana in December 2007. He approached the teller with one of his hands under his jacket and told her that it was a robbery.The teller handed Brown three stacks of bill but he only took a single $100 bill and returned the remaining money back to her. He said that he was homeless and hungry and left the bank.The next day he surrendered to the police voluntarily and told them that his mother didnâ€™t raise him that way.Brown told the police he needed the money to stay at the detox center and had no other place to stay and was hungry.In Caddo District Court, he pleaded guilty. The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison for first degree robbery.We were able to confirm Brown pleaded guilty to first degree robbery on 14 January 2009 and was sentenced to 15 years hard labor without the possibility of probation, parole or suspension of sentence, according to the Caddo Parish court clerkâ€™s office. Brown is currently housed atÂ Madison Parish Detention Center until the end of his sentence in 2022. According to a spokesman for the LouisianaÂ Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Brown has the possibility for work release in 2018, meaning if granted he can leave detention to work during daytime hours.The news article about Brown does not mention factors such as prior convictions which may have affected Brownâ€™s sentence. (In Louisiana, the crime of first degree robbery â€” the taking of something of value when the offender does not have a weapon, but leads the victim to believe that he does have a weapon â€” carries a minimum sentence of 3 years to a maximum of 40 years.) We are working to obtain records containing further details about his case.Allen was sent to prison for his part in aiding and abetting the efforts of TBWâ€™s former chairman, Lee B. Farkas, to defraud the U.S. Treasuryâ€™s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):Allen was chief executive at Ocala, Fla.-based Taylor Bean & Whitaker, which collapsed in 2009 after the criminal investigation became public, resulting in its 2,000 employees losing their jobs. The fraud also contributed to the collapse of Alabama-based Colonial Bank â€” the sixth largest bank failure in U.S. history â€” after Colonial bought hundreds of millions of dollars in Taylor Bean mortgages that had already been sold to other investors.Two other banks â€” Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas â€” lost nearly $2 billion after buying corporate paper from Taylor Bean that was not properly backed with collateral, authorities said.Taylor Bean and Colonial also tried to obtain more than $500 million from the governmentâ€™s Troubled Asset Relief Program but ultimately never received any funding from the program also known as TARP.Neil Barofsky, who served as TARPâ€™s special inspector general, said the Taylor Bean case was the most significant criminal prosecution to arise out of the nationâ€™s financial crisis. The convictions of company chairman Lee Farkas and Allen represent some of the most high-profile executives in the housing and financial industries to receive prison time in the aftermath of the housing sector meltdown.Mitigating factors in Allenâ€™s sentencing were the fact that the fraud was already underway when he became CEO of TBW in 2003, that his crime was a non-violent one, and that Allen was one of six persons who received credit on their sentences for cooperating with investigators and testifying against Farkas, the mastermind of the fraud scheme. (Farkas himself was sentenced to thirty years in prison.)Updated to note we were able to confirm Brown's conviction and location of his detention.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/homeless-man-versus-corporate-thif/,"classism, corporate america, homelessness",snopes,us,,,,

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINIn August 2011 a warning began circulating online, decrying an insect known as the White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar, which is native in Canada from Nova Scotia to Ontario and in the U.S. from the northeast to the south central part of the country:Little white and black caterpillars all over are POISONOUS. they are apparently new to the areaâ€¦.. doctors say there has been numerous kids having reactions to them. the rash spreads fast. the caterpillars have long white hairs that embed in skin and send poison through out the body. DO NOT TOUCH and DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS TOUCH!!! they look cute and fuzzy and THEY ARE NOT! Please repost to everyone you know with little kids!!This caterpillar appears between June and September and munches its way through the leaves of deciduous trees (it prefers nut-bearing trees, but will settle for willow, ash, aspen, apple, oak, and even raspberry plants and corn stalks). While it does make rather a feast of the leaves it dines on, it does not tend to cause lasting damage to the trees themselves.The caterpillar excretes a type of chemical defense upon contact (which is more â€˜allergenicâ€™ than â€˜poisonousâ€™).  Most people who handle these critters will experience a burning, nettle-type, itchy rash of mild to moderate severity, and washing the affected area with soap and water, then applying ammonia or calamine lotion and icing the area should set things to rights.  However, some folks are hypersensitive to the poison and have allergic reactions to it: in addition to the itchy rash, those persons are likely to experience more severe symptoms such as swelling and nausea and should seek expert medical advice as soon as possible:The hairs on the caterpillar are long and bristle-like and spread out in tufts down the sides. Two long, sharp, black pencil-like hairs protrude near the front and rear of the creature, and these hairs are connected to poison glands, which excrete venom on contact.Contact with the venom does not generally cause too much of a problem. A nettle or poison ivy-type rash often occurs, which can range from mild with slight reddening of the skin, to burning, swelling and pain, none of which should keep you away from your gardening duties for too long. Hypersensitive individuals may, of course, experience more severe symptoms that could include swelling and nausea.

Mostly FalseRATINGMostly FalseWHAT'S TRUEPreliminary research indicated dichloroacetate (DCA) might show promise for treating some forms of cancer.WHAT'S FALSEDCA is a not a proven ""cure"" for cancer, nor is it being spurned by pharmaceutical companies because it is not patentable. ORIGINCanadian researchers find a simple cure for cancer, but major pharmaceutical companies are not interested.Researchers at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada have cured cancer last week, yet there is a little ripple in the news or in TV. It is a simple technique using very basic drug. The method employs dichloroacetate, which is currently used to treat metabolic disorders. So, there is no concern of side effects or about their long term effects.This drug doesnâ€™t require a patent, so anyone can employ it widely and cheaply compared to the costly cancer drugs produced by major pharmaceutical companies.Canadian scientists tested this dichloroacetate (DCA) on humanâ€™s cells; it killed lung, breast and brain cancer cells and left the healthy cells alone. It was tested on Rats inflicted with severe tumors; their cells shrank when they were fed with water supplemented with DCA. The drug is widely available and the technique is easy to use, why the major drug companies are not involved? Or the Media interested in this find?In human bodies there is a natural cancer fighting human cell, the mitochondria, but they need to be triggered to be effective. Scientists used to think that these mitochondria cells were damaged and thus ineffective against cancer. So they used to focus on glycolysis, which is less effective in curing cancer and more wasteful. The drug manufacturers focused on this glycolysis method to fight cancer. This DCA on the other hand doesnâ€™t rely on glycolysis instead on mitochondria; it triggers the mitochondria which in turn fights the cancer cells.The side effect of this is it also reactivates a process called apoptosis. You see, mitochondria contain an all-too-important self-destruct button that canâ€™t be pressed in cancer cells. Without it, tumors grow larger as cells refuse to be extinguished. Fully functioning mitochondria, thanks to DCA, can once again die.With glycolysis turned off, the body produces less lactic acid, so the bad tissue around cancer cells doesnâ€™t break down and seed new tumors.Pharmaceutical companies are not investing in this research because DCA method cannot be patented, without a patent they canâ€™t make money, like they are doing now with their AIDS Patent. Since the pharmaceutical companies wonâ€™t develop this, the article says other independent laboratories should start producing this drug and do more research to confirm all the above findings and produce drugs. All the groundwork can be done in collaboration with the Universities, who will be glad to assist in such research and can develop an effective drug for curing cancer.In 2007, medical researchers at the University of Alberta reported that dichloroacetate (DCA), a relatively simple compound, had showed promise for treating cancer in rodent models, and the universityâ€™s DCA Research Team announced they would begin clinical trials of DCA on human patients in the spring of 2007.  One of the members of that research team, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis, expressed concern that because DCA was not patented, the potential profit margins in marketing it would likely be small, and thus it might be difficult to obtain funding for DCA clinical trials from private investors:The DCA compound is not patented and not owned by any pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an inexpensive drug to administer, says Michelakis, the Canada Research Chair in Pulmonary Hypertension and Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Program with Capital Health, one of Canadaâ€™s largest health authorities.However, as DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to test DCA in clinical trials. He is grateful for the support he has already received from publicly funded agencies, such as the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and he is hopeful such support will continue and allow him to conduct clinical trials of DCA on cancer patients.Unfortunately, this preliminary information soon led to hyperbolic claims that a â€œsimple cure for cancerâ€ had been found but a lack of interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies was preventing it from reaching cancer patients, prompting some desperate cancer sufferers to seek it out for themselves from unscrupulous vendors:Note that there were two assumptions about the study [in 2007]. First, these bloggers and pundits assumed that the cell culture and animal work were definitive evidence that DCA might be a â€œcureâ€ for cancer. Second, the assumption was that, because the drug was out of patent and very cheap to make, neither the government nor pharmaceutical companies would be interested in funding it, thus condemning thousands, maybe millions, of people to die of cancer unnecessarily. Unfortunately, [articles] featured headlines to that effect and quotes by the investigator Evangelos Michelakis lamenting how he had had difficulties finding funding to do the next step, clinical trials in cancer. As a result of these sensationalistic stories, unscrupulous â€œbusinessmenâ€ sought to bring DCA to the masses. A frenzy of sorts was unleashed, with desperate cancer patients scrambling to find DCA.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Despite investigatorsâ€™ concerns about potential difficulties in obtaining funding, DCA studies have been undertaken, and in 2010 the substance was in the news again after researchers published a paper reporting their results with testing DCA on glioblastoma tumors:The researchers looked at the impact of DCA on tumor cells from patients with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma, which generally does not respond well to treatment.They performed some very sophisticated lab experiments which demonstrated the impact of DCA on the tumor cells from 49 patients with this cancer.  The experiments generally support the effectiveness of DCA at altering cell behavior.The investigators also treated five patients who had glioblastoma with DCA.  The only side effect they found was a reversible change in peripheral nerve function.  No other side effects were described.  Of the five patients, three had progressing disease despite prior treatment and two were newly diagnosed. Those two patients were treated with different protocols.  The results of the treatments were variable as were the approaches to treatment.  Nonetheless, the report shows some MRI pictures pre and post treatment which show regression of the cancers in two patients.As Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for the national office of the American Cancer Society, wrote of that last study in 2010, DCA studies appear to be worth pursuing, but the substance is still far from being proved an effective treatment for any type of cancer, much less a cancer â€œcureâ€:How would I characterize this report? Simply stated, the science is intriguing and I believe is something to be pursued both in the lab and in the clinic.  BUT, and this is a big but, it is not a cure for glioblastoma or any other cancer based on these results. My concern is that this paper is going to be transformed â€” like the last one â€” into something that it is not, namely that this is definitive evidence that DCA is the magic bullet for cancer treatment, particularly in glioblastoma (which is a cancer that has a very poor prognosis).This research still needs lots of work before we know whether it works or doesnâ€™t work, and whether it is really safe or not when given to patients with cancer under a variety of circumstances. If that sounds overly cautious, so be it.  I have seen too many dashed hopes in my medical career which make me a bit cautious about reports like this.  Thatâ€™s not to say I donâ€™t think it could work â€” it could, as I mentioned above â€” but I want to see evidence in well done trials that prove the point that DCA is effective in the treatment of which cancers under what circumstances.In the case of DCA, internet traffic zoomed with reports of its purported success in curing cancer â€” in lab animals.  Clinics sprung up, and are probably still active.  The risk is that we are going to see a resurgence of this now that the new report has been issued.We shall see how this progresses.  Hopefully, clinical trials will proceed appropriately. And I stand by my skepticism, while encouraging further research to answer the fundamental question whether or not DCA really works in treating cancer.In the meantime, caution is advised.  Donâ€™t become the victim of a cancer scam.  The scamsters are sure to follow this report as night follows day.As New Scientist noted as recently as July 2016, dichloroacetate still has not lived up to the potential ascribed to it several years ago:Almost a decade ago, New Scientist broke a story about dichloroacetate (DCA), a simple chemical used to treat rare metabolic disorders that was also showing remarkable cancer-killing properties. We were inundated with requests for more information â€” including how to enroll in clinical trials or buy the drug online.DCA was worth investigating as a cancer treatment, but [it] has yet to live up to its promise. The US Food and Drug Administration eventually had to step in and shut down websites selling it illegally.",mostly false,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dca-cancer-cure/,cancer cures,snopes,us,,,,

Soles, Jr. announced at the end of 2009 that he would not be seeking re-election to his office representing the 8th district in the North Carolina Senate, he stepped down as the longest-serving legislator in that state, having served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1969 to 1976 and from 1977 onwards in the Senate.  Solesâ€™ decision not to run for re-election again may have been influenced by an August 2009 incident in which Soles shot 22-year-old Kyle Blackburn in the leg, claiming that he had fired in self-defense after Blackburn and another young man trespassed on his property and attempted to kick in his door.  In February 2010, Soles pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon charge:The 75-year-old claim[ed] he shot Blackburn in self defense after Blackburn and 23-year-old Billie Wright kicked at his door.  Soles faced charges of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.  Blackburn has since recovered from the shooting.During the trial, the state used a 40-minute surveillance tape taken at Solesâ€™ home during the time of the shooting as evidence.  The state said Blackburn, Wright, and a woman spent more than an hour trespassing on the senatorâ€™s property, drinking alcohol before kicking the door.Solesâ€™ attorney, Joe Chesire, said the state gave a fair account of what happened the night of the shooting, and that the senator wanted to take responsibility for his actions.  He will pay more than $1,000 in court costs.However, commentaries on the shooting (like the one reproduced above) which portrayed Senator Soles as a hypocritical, virulently anti-gun legislator â€œwho has made a career of being against gun ownership for the general publicâ€ are not supported by the evidence.  According to Project VoteSmart, the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), the NRA political action committee that ranks political candidates based on voting records, public statements and their responses to NRA-PVF questionnaires, had assigned the following grades to Senator Soles over the previous decade:o 1998 â€” Bo 2000 â€” B+o 2002 â€” B+o 2004 â€” Ao 2006 â€” Ao 2008 â€” Aeval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));As well, Grass Roots North Carolina (GRNC), an â€œorganization dedicated to preserving individual rights, particularly your right to keep and bear armsâ€ said of the criticisms of Senator Soles:An alert from a national organization not up to speed on local North Carolina political issues condemning Senator R.C. SOLES over the recent shooting at his home has been circulating recently. Part of a fund raising alert from the National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) calls Soles â€œthe most virulent anti-Second Amendment activist in the stateâ€ and the â€œmost vociferous anti-gun zealot in North Carolina.â€ As much fun as it is to catch anti-gun politicians in their own hypocrisy, this is not such a case.

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINIn 2003, a study of U.S. accident data performed by University of Toronto researchers uncovered a 41% increase in motor vehicle collisions in the hours following the Super Bowl. The study compared crash data from 27 Super Bowl Sundays with that of the Sundays preceding and following the big game from 1975 to 2001. The first hour immediately following the Super Bowl was the worst, with the accident rate jumping 70%. (There was a 10% drop in the accident rate during the game itself, presumably because far fewer people were on the road on that time.)The study, subsequently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the largest surges in the accident rate occurred in the home states of the losing team, where the number of crashes increased 68% after the telecast ended, while accidents rose only 6% in the winnerâ€™s state. Accidents climbed an average of 46% in â€œneutralâ€ states.The average number of people killed in crashes after the Super Bowl was 24, up from 17 on the comparison Sundays. Likewise, the number of people injured in automobile accidents jumped to 1,900 from 1,300, and the number of crashes topped 4,000, up from nearly 3,000.The researchers theorized that drinking during the game, driver fatigue because of the late hour, and distraction and disappointment among drivers whose teams lost all contributed to the rise in accidents. â€œWe think that it may be alcohol and fatigue and inattention, and in particular the sort of what-if conjectures and Monday morning quarterbacking that occursâ€ after the loss, said Dr. Donald A.

I believe it can also save and create jobs in America while giving people better customer service.So, how many times have you called a companies service phone line and found that the rep. can barely speak English? Once with a major mortgage company it was so bad I demanded to speak with someone who spoke English. Right at that moment I broke the code, the secret password for customer service.Come to find out that every American company using overseas operators must transfer you to an American rep. by saying â€œI want to speak to a representative in America.â€ (Donâ€™t take no for an answer on this)This was confirmed by the American rep. that they must transfer you after that request. Iâ€™ve tried it on a half a dozen major companies including cable, bank, phone and mortgage companies. It works every time and I actually get my issues taken care of.Another thing to help save even more jobs â€¦ donâ€™t use the automated check out lanes they are pushing at the big box stores. Once again, I found out that if we use those check outs rather than cashiers, people lose their jobs too. Iâ€™ve refused to use the automated check outs and have had two cashiers already thank me for help saving their job. I didnâ€™t know we could do this, and will start doing it from now on to keep Americans working.Please consider doing the following when you are talking on the phone to any US customer service representative that is based in a foreign country (like India).  I have done this twice and it works!  Any time you call an 800 number (for a credit card, banking, charter communications, health insurance, insurance, you name it) and you are transferred to a representative (like in India), please consider doing the following:After you connect and you realize that the customer service representative is not from the USA (you can always ask if you are not sure about the accent), please very politely (very politely â€“ this is not about trashing other cultures) say, â€œIâ€™d like to speak to a customer service representative in the United States of America.â€  The rep might suggest talking to his/her manager, but, again, politely say, â€œThank you, but Iâ€™d like to speak to a customer service representative in the USA.â€  YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED to a rep in the USA.   It only takes less than one minute to have your call redirected to the USA. Tonight when I got redirected to a USA rep, I asked again to make sure â€“ and yes, she was from Fort Lauderdale.Imagine if tomorrow, every US citizen who has to make such a call and then requests a US rep, imagine how that would ultimately impact the number of US jobs that would need to be created ASAP.  Imagine what would happen if every US citizen insisted on talking to only US phone reps from this day on.If I tell 10 people to consider this and you tell 10 people to consider doing this â€“ see what I meanâ€¦Remember â€“ the goal here is to restore jobs back here at home â€“ not to be abrupt or rude to a foreign phone rep.  If you agree, please tell 10 people you know and tell them to tell 10 people they knowâ€¦.etcâ€¦etcâ€¦800-ASK-4-USA-DO NOT DELETE BEFORE READING !The gas company serving this area brought their call center back to Phoenix from India last year after numerous customer complaints.  What a difference now when you call themâ€¦and it created 300 jobs.  I know this works because they were so bad that when India answered I wouldnâ€™t even deal with them.  Iâ€™d simply ask to be transferred to a supervisor in theU.S. and they would comply.Now that I know it is the LAW â€“ I will do it for sureAny time you call an 800 number (for a credit card, banking, Verizon, health and other insurance, computer help desk, etc) and you find that youâ€™re talking to a foreign customer service representative (perhaps in India , Philippines , etc), please consider doing the following:After you connect and you realize that the customer service representative is not from the USA (you can always ask if you are not sure about the accent), please, very politely (this is not about trashing other cultures) say, â€œIâ€™d like to speak to a customer service representative in the United States of America..â€The rep might suggest talking to his/her manager, but, again, politely say, â€œThank you, but Iâ€™d like to speak to a customer servicerepresentative in the USA.â€YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED TO A REP IN THE USA.

In September 2009, Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania took a stab at the issue by introducing the Call Center Consumerâ€™s Right to Know Act (HR 3621) to Congress, a bill which sought to â€œrequire employees at a call center who either initiate or receive telephone calls to disclose the physical location of such employees.â€  That bill was referred to a House subcommittee with no further action taken.In May 2010, Senator Charles Schumer of New York addressed a similar issue when he announced he would be introducing legislation which would require U.S. callers be informed when their calls were being transferred to a foreign country and would impose a $0.25 per call excise tax on any customer service calls placed inside the United States that were transferred to agents in foreign locations.  Despite the announcement, Senator Schumer has not yet introduced any such legislation to Congress.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000003','ezslot_3']));In 2013, Rep.

The alleged crime took place at the Mourning Glory Mortuary just outside of Lexington, Missouri. Police have charged Felicity Marmaduke with desecration of the dead and necrophilia.According to a statement made to police by Marmaduke, the alleged victim experienced a post mortem erection while being bathed. Being alone, Marmaduke straddled the dead man and proceeded have sex with him. Much to her surprise, the alleged victim came to orgasm after several minutes. A few weeks later, Marmaduke had a positive pregnancy test while receiving a routine medical exam. Upon telling her doctor the circumstances leading to the conception, the police were notified. Marmaduke was arrested without incident at her dilapidated trailer home a few blocks from the mortuary.Although the news media occasionally report real cases of workers or interlopers at mortuaries/cemeteries attempting to engage in sex with bodies of the deceased, this item about a female mortuary workerâ€™s becoming pregnant through such an activity is not one of them.

are requested for the Darkhorse Marine battalion fighting in Afghanistan.,"CLAIM					Prayers are requested for the Darkhorse Marine battalion fighting in Afghanistan.									OutdatedRATINGOutdatedORIGINA simple prayer request for the Darkhorse Marine battalion fighting in Afghanistan was initially spread via social media in late 2010:We are asking everyone to say a prayer for â€œDarkhorseâ€ 3rd Battalion 5th Marines and their families. They are fighting it out in Afghanistan and have lost 9 marines in 4 days. Please repost this.Even more than indicated in that Facebook-circulated prayer request, the U.S. 3rd Battalion, Â 5th Marines (Darkhorse) suffered heavy personnel losses in Afghanistan between October 2010 and its return to Camp Pendleton in April 2011.  According to the San Diego Â Union-Tribune, thirteen members of the battalion were killed in the October/November 2010 timeframe:An infantryman from Camp Pendletonâ€™s 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment was killed in action in Afghanistan, the Pentagon announced [on 8 November 2010].Lance Cpl. Randy R. Braggs, 21, of Sierra Vista, Ariz., died Nov. 6 while conducting combat operations in Helmand province, the Department of Defense said.Braggs was the 13th member of 3/5 killed since the battalion moved into the Sangin area of northeastern Helmand province in October, including four felled in a single bomb attack on their mine-resistant all terrain vehicle.Two other Marines were fatally shot at a patrol base last week in Sangin, the Marines said. Initial reports indicate they were attacked by a rogue Afghan soldier who then fled, according to U.S. and NATO officials in Afghanistan. An investigation into the incident is continuing.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));As noted in an Associated Press account, the area of Afghanistan in which the 3/5 operated is regarded as a particularly key (and violent) area of that country:U.S. Marines who recently inherited this lush river valley in southern Helmand province from British forces have tossed aside their predecessorâ€™s playbook in favor of a more aggressive strategy to tame one of the most violent places in Afghanistan.U.S. commanders say success is critical in Sangin district â€” where British forces suffered nearly one-third of their deaths in the war â€” because it is the last remaining sanctuary in Helmand where the Taliban can freely process the opium and heroin that largely fund the insurgency.The district also serves as a key crossroads to funnel drugs, weapons and fighters throughout Helmand and into neighboring Kandahar province, the spiritual heartland of the Taliban and the most important battleground for coalition forces. The U.S.-led coalition hopes its offensive in the south will kill or capture key Taliban commanders, rout militants from their strongholds and break the insurgencyâ€™s back. That will allow the coalition and the Afghans to improve government services, bring new development and a sense of security.Another Associated Press report from November 2010 described the difficulty (and heavy casualties) the Marines were encountering during operations in that region of Afghanistan:The Marines patrolling through the green fields and tall mud compounds of Helmand provinceâ€™s Sangin district say they are literally in a race for their lives. They are trying to adjust their tactics to outwit Taliban fighters, who have killed more coalition troops here than in any other Afghan district this year.â€œAs a new unit coming in, you are at a distinct disadvantage because the Taliban have been fighting here for years, have established fighting positions and have laid the ground with a ton of IEDs,â€ said Lt. Col. Jason Morris, commander of the 3rd Battalion, Â 5th Marine Regiment. â€œYou have to evolve quickly because you have no other choice.â€Many of the younger Marines also have had to cope for the first time with seeing their best friends die or suffer grievous wounds. Fifteen Marines have been killed and about 50 wounded since the battalion arrived in October [2010] â€” many by improvised explosive devices or IEDs.Between 8 October 2010 and its April 2011 return home, the 3/5 lost 24 Marines while conducting Operation Enduring Freedom combat operations in Helmand province: Sgt.

In many cases these manipulated photographs depict people in imminent danger from large, dangerous, scary animals, such as widely-circulated images of a hapless parachutist about to descend into a lake surrounded by alligators, or scuba divers (both military and civilian) who are shown as being mere seconds away from becoming a sharkâ€™s next meal.A popular online image is of similar ilk, seemingly showing a kayaker in Sitka, Alaska, scooting across the gaping, soon-to-be-gulping jaw of a humpback whale:This story/photo is from Dr. Kraft who is a physician in Sitka.Wow, what are the chances of taking this picture just at this moment:Yep, that is me in the picture. Yep that is a whale that was just around the corner from the ferry terminal.â€œPaddle really fastâ€ is the only thing I could think of at the time.Also thinking that I donâ€™t look like a herring, donâ€™t smell like a herring but with the same herring instinct of â€œget the hell out of the way of that big mouth!!â€Still living to tell yet another storyâ€¦Like many such images, this is a manufactured phony, a jape created by merging two photographs taken at different times and places:eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));Â One interesting difference in this case is that the whale/kayak composite was not created by some anonymous Internet prankster, but by the original photographer himself, Tim Shobe, who explained how he came to create it:Being bored one night and looking through my images, I came across some photos of whales that I took and then one of my friend Richard from here in Sitka while he was in his kayak. These two images were from two completely different times and locations (roughly 3 months apart). I came up with the idea to create a manipulated image with the help of Photoshop to use as a small piece of entertainment for a few of my friends on my email list. The whale image of mine that I used for this piece was one of many captured during a day in which I blessed to have witnessed several humpback whales bubblenetting and lunge feeding.A March 2010 article in the Daily Sitka Sentinel detailed how the composite was set loose and spread via the Internet:Sitkan Tim Shobe is known for taking photos so good theyâ€™re â€œunbelievable.â€ But none is quite so unbelievable as the one he took of his friend Rich Kraft paddling through the mouth of a bubble-feeding humpback. The photo of the humpback is real, and so is the one of Kraft. But the two together? Not real.â€œHe sent it to me, and I showed it around work,â€ said Kraft, who is a physician at SEARHC-Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital. The image included a quip about Kraft conducting an oral exam. â€œIt was just a picture to get a chuckle,â€ Kraft said. He thought his friends would enjoy Shobeâ€™s photographic and PhotoShop skills â€” and the joke â€” and sent it along to a few people.But in the world of the Internet, such things take on a life of their own. Before Kraft knew it, the photo had come back to him after reaching several other people. The question was always: â€œIs this real?â€The photo of him in the kayak was taken last winter, when he and Shobe were out kayaking near the ferry terminal. The photo of the whale was taken two weeks ago in Nakwasina Sound. Shobe said he was surprised not only that people took the photo at face value, but also at the wide distribution of his PhotoShopped image.The same image resurfaced in July 2016, with some small changes: Kraft was a dentist rather than a physician, and the picture was credited to someone named Mark Tennant.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/big-gulp/,"animals, sitka, whale",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINMemorial Day, now observed on the last Monday of May, is the day of the year set aside for Americans to commemorate the men and women of the United States who died while in the military service. On Memorial Day the President of the United States traditionally visits Arlington National Cemetery, where Americaâ€™s honored dead are interred, to deliver a speech in remembrance of those who died in service to their country and to lay a memorial wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.President Obamaâ€™s decision to spend the 2010 Memorial Day weekend in Chicago rather than attending memorial services in Arlington engendered claims that he thus became the first U.S. president to skip the Arlington wreath-laying ceremony since the inception of Memorial Day:Mike Savage stated that President Obama was not going to Arlington this Memorial Day but is sending VP Biden in his place. Obama is going to Chicago instead. Savage stated that this is the first time in history that a President has not laid a wreath at Arlington on Memorial day.This claim was inaccurate: On several occasions in just the last thirty years, U.S. presidents have been elsewhere on Memorial Day (either vacationing or attending to different presidential duties) while other administration officials represented them at the wreath-laying ceremony:In 2002, President George W. Bush was in France on Memorial Day and participated in ceremonies at Normandy (site of the D-Day landings) honoring the U.S. soldiers who fought and died in World War II. In his place, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.  President George H.W. Bush (himself a World War II veteran) attended no ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery during his four years in office. In 1989 he was in Rome on Memorial Day (where he led observances at an American military cemetery south of that city), and from 1990 through 1992 he spent the Memorial Day weekend vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, while Vice-President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.President Ronald Reagan was away from Arlington on Memorial Day on four occasions during his eight years in office: In 1981, Reagan (having been seriously wounded in an assassination attempt six weeks earlier) spent the Memorial Day weekend at his ranch in Santa Barbara, California, while Vice-President George H.W. Bush laid the wreath at Arlington. In 1983, he attended a summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia, while Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Thayer represented the administration at the wreath-laying ceremony. In 1987, Reagan spent Memorial Day at the Camp David presidential retreat while Navy Secretary James Webb participated in the wreath-laying ceremony. And on Memorial Day 1988, he was out of the U.S., attending a summit meeting in Moscow.Bill Clinton was the only U.S. President in the last 30+ years to have attended Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington every year throughout his term of office.On Memorial Day 2010, President Obama was scheduled to honor Americaâ€™s fallen heroes with a speech at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery near Chicago, while Vice-President Joe Biden took his place at Arlington; however, a thunderstorm in Illinois interrupted the former ceremony, and President Obama returned to Washington to deliver his speech at Andrews Air Force Base. With the exception of that one year, President Obama has participated in wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery every Memorial Day (2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) during his administration.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/potus-at-arlington-on-memorial-day/,"arlington national cemetery, barack obama, memorial day",snopes,us,,,,

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINâ€œBottle bombsâ€ (also commonly known as â€œDrano bombsâ€ or â€œworks bombsâ€) are not a new phenomenon; theyâ€™ve been a favorite of youthful pranksters for decades, as their construction requires only a few ordinary, commonly available components: plastic soda bottles, aluminum foil, and Drano (or other brand of household drain or toilet cleaner):Good morning to you all. I want to make you aware of a recent incident that occurred this morning in York Twp. This type of incident directly affects your safety as well as your childrenâ€™s safety. This morning, at approximately 8:00 am, I was dispatched to an address, on Bemis Rd near the Saline City Limits, for an unexploded pop bottle bomb. When I arrived, I noticed a 20 ounce pop bottle, on the ground, in the callers front yard. After I inspected it closer, I determined that it was in fact a â€œWorksâ€ Bomb. I was able to clear the device away from the house and once I moved it, it detonated itself within 30 seconds. After leaving that house, I checked other yards in the area during my patrols. I located a second one, just a few doors down from the first one. As I took care of the disposal/detonation, the homeowner came out and asked me what it was. When I showed her what it was, she immediately told me that she saw the bottle and that she had planned on picking it up when she got her morning paper. Like the first one, once I moved it, it detonated in short order. There was a high probability that this would have detonated in her hand/face while she carried it to the trash.A â€œWorksâ€ Bomb is Drain-o and Tin Foil, mixed together inside of a bottle. The chemical reaction between the Drain-o and the Tin Foil makes a volatile build up of gases and subsequently detonates the bottle with a great amount of force. Once the detonation occurs, the chemical substance that is in the bottle is actually boiling liquid.The amount of force that is generated at the time of the explosion is enough to severe fingers and also deliver 2nd and 3rd degree chemical burns to the victim. The chemicals can possibly cause blindness and the toxic fumes can be harmful.**SAFETY**SAFETY**SAFETY***â€¦â€¦â€¦.When you are out and about in your yards, please be mindful of these devices. If your picking up your morning paper, or mowing your grass, or if you let your children out to play; whatever your activities are, please use the following precautions.1) If you find a soda bottle or any other bottles, examine it carefully before you touch it or get near it. If it shows signs of swelling, ormelting in any way, DO NOT TOUCH IT! Call 911 and let us respond to take care of it.2) If you find a soda bottle that has any liquid in it, DO NOT TOUCH IT! Call 911 and let us respond to check it / dispose of it.Both bombs this morning appeared to be slightly swollen, with a dark colored liquid, inside of it. This liquid could have easily been mistaken for left over soda.I know that calling 911 for a soda bottle may sound silly or like a misuse of your Police protection but trust me, it is not. You do not want one of these devices detonating in your hand or your childrenâ€™s hands or in your pets face. We are here to incur the danger for you so that you are and your loved ones are not harmed. So please check your yard thoroughly before letting your children out to play and be mindful before you just deem that soda bottle as garbage and pick it up.In closing, please educate your children on the dangers and consequences of making these devices. It has become popular with the youth in the past few years, to do this as a prank, but there have been some changes to the law. Not only could it be deadly to the maker or the victim, but making one these devices is called, â€œPossession of a Substance with Explosive Capabilitiesâ€. If it causes no damage, its a 15 year Felony. If it causes damage, its a 20 year Felony. If it causes physical injury, its a 25 year Felony. If it causes serious injury, the penalty can be â€œUp to lifeâ€, and if it causes death, its Mandatory Life without the possibility of Parole. These are statutory guidelines only. These penalties are what could be imposed but it does not necessarily mean that these penalties would be imposed.In general, one need simply push some aluminum foil balls into a plastic bottle, add some Drano, and screw the cap tightly onto the bottle. The combination of the hydrogen chloride or sodium hydroxide in the fluid and the aluminum foil creates a strong chemical reaction which releases hydrogen gas; when that gas builds up to sufficient pressure, it ruptures the side of the plastic bottle, releasing the contents in an explosive burst:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_4']));Although the force of pressure-based bottle bombs may seem small when compared to other types of explosives (such as gunpowder-based ones), any form of explosive has the potential to cause serious injury, and since bottle bombs have no conventional fuse they can be dangerously unpredictable, exploding earlier or later than their wielders expect. (Aluminum foil is typically coated with a layer of wax, so it can take up to ten minutes or so for the fluid to strip away the wax and react with the aluminum foil, enhancing the chances that a soon-to-explode bottle bomb may be picked up by an unwary passer-by.) Additionally, the caustic cleaning agents used in bottle bombs can cause severe burns when they come into contact with skin (either through spillage in the construction of the bombs or through being sprayed widely in the resulting explosions) and produce toxic fumes.The above-quoted e-mail warning about neighborhood residents discovering undetonated bottle bombs in their yards was sent out by Washtenaw County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Keith Mansell in April 2010 after he discovered two Drano bombs left in the yards of residents of York Township, Michigan. For the most part, those who concoct bottle bombs mix the ingredients, immediately set their work aside, and stand back to watch it explode within a minute or two. However, there are ways of delaying the mixture and/or reaction of the ingredients so as to cause a delayed detonation, so those who discover objects that appear to be bottle bombs should refrain from handling them and contact authorities for removal.At about the same time as Deputy Mansellâ€™s warning hit the Internet, the town of Methuen, Massachusetts, experienced a rash of similar plastic-bottle bomb placements, including two that blew apart mailboxes:A rash of homemade plastic-bottle bombs used to blow up mailboxes has prompted arson investigators and the state police fire marshalâ€™s office to offer up to a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone responsible for making and setting off the incendiary devices.[Methuen police arson investigator Matt] Bistany said [a plastic bottle a resident discovered sticking out the front of her mailbox] is at least the third device of its kind found in the neighborhood in the last few weeks, although in the two other cases, the bombs actually succeeded in blowing apart the mailboxes.Barry said the bombs, made up of typical household chemicals poured into plastic bottles and then sealed shut with the cap, can be very powerful.â€œWe take these very seriously,â€ he said. â€œKids have lost their fingers and had their faces injured from these things. Itâ€™s very serious.â€eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_6']));Some more cases of bottle bomb discoveries include one such item found on an Oregon elementary school playground on 18 February 2013:A chemical-based bottle bomb, mixed inside a Gatorade container, was discovered on the playground of Periwinkle Elementary School, and the Oregon State Police responded to destroy the device, according to Albany Police Department reports.A caller reported the bomb, which was under the covered play structure, to 911.The OSP bomb squad arrived, detonated the bottle and seized it as evidence. The bottle has been sent to the Oregon State Police Crime Lab for testing.A woman residing in Wichita, Kansas, called police on 16 February 2013 after someone detonated bottle bombs nearby:A 24-year-old woman called police after hearing several explosions [outside]. She also reported seeing three teenage males wearing dark clothing fleeing from her house.When officers arrived on the scene, they found the remnants of chemical bombs in melted two-liter pop bottles. The bomb squad was then called, according to Wichita police Sgt. Bart Brunscheen, to dispose of the contents.â€œThis is a serious crime and anybody near it could be injured,â€ he said.Also in February 2013, police in Beavercreek, Ohio, warned residents about a recent rash of bottle bomb incidents in the community:Beavercreek Police are investigating their 7th pop bottle bomb incident and now theyâ€™re asking for your help. Police warn that these devices are extremely dangerous. So far, no one has been hurt but they say itâ€™s only a matter of time.The incidents have taken place in the Hunterâ€™s Ridge, Christalee Acres and Oakbrook Chase Estates neighborhoods. The most recent incident happened at the intersection of Oakbrook Boulevard and Adams Way. Police found two pop bottle bombs and disposed of them safely. They say there are no witnesses.This investigation began on December 13th of last year. Since then, police have found several of these devices and the Dayton Bomb Squad has been called to detonate some of them. If you find a similar device, youâ€™re asked to call 9-1-1 immediately, and do not try to pick it up or move it.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/drano-bottle-bombs/,crime warnings,snopes,us,,,,

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINThe first day of April, commonly known as April Foolâ€™s Day, is an occasion for much pranking in the real and online worlds, and among the common japes that take place in the latter realm are news sitesâ€™ presenting their readers with absurd and ridiculous stories offered as straightforward reporting. That mechanism occasionally works in reverse, however: in some years, news stories that sound far-fetched but are actually true break on April 1, leading many readers to dismiss them as mere April Foolâ€™s humor. That was the case in 2010, when a video clip of an odd exchange which had taken place during a House committee meeting a week earlier was circulated widely on April 1:During a House Armed Services Committee meeting held on 25 March 2010, Representative Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Lithonia, Georgia, questioned Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, about a proposal to move 8,000 Marines from the Japanese island of Okinawa to the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. In the course of that questioning, Rep. Johnson expressed concern that adding thousands of Marines and their families to Guam might cause that small island to â€œtip over and capsizeâ€:Johnson: This is a[n] island that at its widest level is what â€¦ twelve miles from shore to shore? And at its smallest level â€¦ uh, smallest location â€¦ itâ€™s seven miles between one shore and the other? Is that correct?Willard: I donâ€™t have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.Johnson: Very small island, about twenty-four miles, if I recall, long, twenty-four miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about twelve miles wide on the widest part of the island, and I donâ€™t know how many square miles that is. Do you happen to know?Willard: I donâ€™t have that figure with me, sir, I can certainly supply it to you if you like.Johnson: Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.Willard: We donâ€™t anticipate that â€¦ the Guam population I think currently about 175,000 and again with 8,000 Marines and their families itâ€™s an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.Johnson: And also things like the environment, the sensitive areas of the environment, coral reefs and those kinds of things, and I know that lots of people donâ€™t like to think about that but â€¦ you know, we donâ€™t think about global warming either, and now we do have to think about it, and so Iâ€™m concerned from an environmental standpoint whether or not Guam is the best place to do this relocation. but itâ€™s actually the only place, is that correct?Willard: This is the best place, this is the farthest west U.S. territory that we own and this is part of our nation, and in readdressing the forward presence and posture importance to Pacific Command, Guam is vital to this decision.This exchange was the subject of much ridicule and speculation: Was Rep. Johnson really expressing concern that the addition of 8,000 Marines and their families to Guam would literally cause the island to become â€œso overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,â€ or was he engaging in a metaphor about concerns over the level of environmental degradation that might result from a sudden 14% increase in Guamâ€™s population?eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));The latter viewpoint is bolstered by the fact that immediately after his â€œtip over and capsizeâ€ statement, Johnson did explicitly say he was concerned about â€œthe sensitive areas of the environment, coral reefs and those kinds of things.â€ On the other hand, Johnsonâ€™s prefacing that statement with the words â€œAnd also things like the environment â€¦â€ (and his curious fixation on Guamâ€™s exact dimensions) could be taken to mean that his previously expressed fear â€œthat the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsizeâ€ was a different subject and was therefore not a metaphor for environmental issues.Or perhaps Johnson was clumsily trying to express the notion that adding another 25,000 people to Guam would create an unsustainably large population (and thus the island would reach its â€œtipping pointâ€).Only Johnson knows for sure what he was thinking as he questioned Admiral Willard, and he later claimed he was â€œspeaking metaphoricallyâ€ and â€œkiddingâ€ (although critics noted no trace of humor was apparent in his words, tone, or body language, nor did he react or offer correction when Admiral Willard addressed his concerns about the islandâ€™s â€œtipping overâ€ as if they were meant literally):4th District Congressman Hank Johnson is now backing away from an outlandish suggestion he made to a United States Navy admiral that the Pacific island of Guam could â€œtip over and capsizeâ€ if too many U.S. Marines are stationed there.Johnson said â€œmy fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.â€In an interview, the Decatur Democrat said he was kidding and simply speaking metaphorically to make a point during the committee hearing.Johnson said, â€œI can say things that are quite humorous and not smile about it and it leads people to think about what I said.â€â€œOften, Iâ€™ve been known to use humor as I deliver a message. Thatâ€™s just one of the gifts that I think that I have,â€ Johnson deadpanned.â€œIâ€™ve been around long enough in this district for voters to know that if Hank said Guam is in danger of capsizing, they would know precisely that I have a sense of humor.â€As of this writing, Hank Johnson Jr. is still the U.S. Representative for Georgiaâ€™s 4th congressional district.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tipping-point/,guam,snopes,us,,,,

POWs in Monopoly Games?,TRUE,Maps and other escape aids were smuggled to Allied POWs in Monopoly sets during World War II.,"CLAIM					Maps and other escape aids were smuggled to Allied POWs in Monopoly sets during World War II.											SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail, May 2009							Starting  in 1941, an increasing number of British Airmen found themselves as the involuntary guests of the Third Reich, and  the Crown was casting about for ways and means to facilitate their escape.Now  obviously, one of the most helpful aids to that end is a  useful and accurate map, one showing not  only where stuff was, but also showing the locations of 'safe houses' where a POW on-the-lam could go for food and  shelter.Paper  maps had some real drawbacks â€” they make a lot of noise when  you open and fold them, they wear out rapidly, and if they get  wet, they turn into mush.Someone  in MI-5 (similar to America's OSS) got the idea of printing escape maps on silk. It's durable, can be scrunched-up into  tiny wads, and unfolded as many times as needed, and makes no  noise whatsoever.At  that time, there was only one manufacturer in Great Britain  that had perfected the technology of printing on silk, and  that was John Waddington, Ltd. When approached by the  government, the firm was only too happy to do its bit for the  war effort.By  pure coincidence, Waddington was also the U.K. Licensee for  the popular American board game, Monopoly. As it happened,  'games and pastimes' was a category of item qualified for  insertion into 'CARE packages', dispatched by the  International Red Cross to prisoners ofwar.Under  the strictest of secrecy, in a securely guarded and  inaccessible old workshop on the grounds of Waddington's, a  group of sworn-to-secrecy employees began mass-producing  escape maps, keyed to each region of Germany or Italy where  Allied POW camps were regional system). When processed, these  maps could be folded into such tiny dots that they would actually fit inside a Monopoly playing  piece.As long as they were at it, the clever workmen at Waddington's also managed to add:1. A playing token, containing a small  magnetic compass 2. A two-part metal file that could easily  be screwed together 3. Useful amounts of genuine  high-denomination German, Italian, and French currency, hidden  within the piles of Monopoly money! British  and American air crews were advised, before taking off on  their first mission, how to identify a 'rigged' Monopoly set â€” by means of a tiny red dot, one cleverly rigged to look  like an ordinary printing glitch, located in the corner of the  Free Parking square.Of  the estimated 35,000 Allied POWS who successfully escaped, an estimated one-third were aided in their flight by the rigged Monopoly sets. Everyone who did so was sworn to secrecy  indefinitely, since the British Government might want to use  this highly successful ruse in still another, future war.The story wasn't declassified until 2007, when the surviving  craftsmen from Waddington's, as well as the firm itself, were  finally honored in a public ceremony.It's always nice when you can play that 'Get Out of Jail' Free'  card!						TrueRATINGTrueORIGINThe gist of this account about maps (and other items useful for escape efforts) being smuggled to Allied POWs during World War II by cleverly hiding them in Monopoly game sets is true, although some of the finer details in this particular account may be inaccurate.The general outline of the scheme to smuggle escape aids to POWs through specially manufactured Monopoly kits is recounted (among other places) in The Game Makers, a 2004 history of the Parker Brothers game company:When allied airmen began to risk their lives flying missions over occupied Europe, Parker Brothersâ€™ English partner found a way to use the Monopoly game to come to the aid of those who were captured by the Germans. The British War Office worked with a select group of Waddington staffers to modify Monopoly boards for insertion in games that the Red Cross would deliver to Allied prisoners of war. These men carved out precise depressions in the unfinished game boards and, before applying their labels, filled them with low-profile compasses, files, and maps that depicted escape routes from the prison camp where each game was to be sent. (The maps were printed on silk because silk did not rustle when opened. Waddingtonâ€™s had perfected this process to such an extent that virtually all British flyers climbed into their warplanes with a Waddingtonâ€™s map secreted in the heel of one of their boots.) Hidden among the gamesâ€™ play money was real currency â€” German, Italian, or Austrian. It is not known how many airmen escaped thanks to these Monopoly games.Regardless of when it may have been officially declassified, information about the rigged Monopoly kits was openly acknowledged and discussed long before 2007.  A 1985 Associated Press article, for example, reported that:Waddingtons, which received the license to distribute Monopoly in Britain in 1935 from Parker Brothers in the United States, got involved in aiding the prisoners of war because of its printing expertise. It printed maps for the military on durable silk.Thousands of fliers who went on missions over German-occupied Europe had the maps sewn into their uniforms if they were shot down and captured.Victor Watson, chairman of the firm, said Waddingtons had a secret department that put the maps, files and money in shallow recesses on the board under the paper face. Then MI-9, the division of Military Intelligence devoted to helping POWs escape, smuggled the sets into prison camps as recreational equipment.Powell Davies, who was a 19-year-old flier when he was captured, said the prison escape committees would destroy the sets after removing the escape aids to keep the guards from figuring out what was going on.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Although the account claims â€œan estimated one-third [of escaped POWs] were aided in their flight by the rigged Monopoly sets,â€ both the Game Makers excerpt quoted above and Waddingtonâ€™s chairman said the number of POWs who were actually aided by the smuggled game kits is unknown:Maps, files and compasses were hidden in Monopoly sets and smuggled into World War II German prison camps to help British prisoners of war escape, the gameâ€™s manufacturer, the John Waddington company of Leeds, England, says.  Monopoly boards were made with maps hidden in them showing â€œescape routes from the particular prison to which each game was sent,â€ chairman Victor Watson said. â€œInto the other side of the board was inserted a tiny compass and several fine-quality files.â€ The money piles were real money, with one piece of Monopoly money on the top and bottom of the pack. â€œWe are not sure how many prisoners were able to escape by this method,â€ Watson said, but the company likes to think a few did.A former archivist with John Waddington also pointed out some discrepancies in the account in response to a 2007 London Times recounting of it:Sir, I write as the former archivist for John Waddington, the company which made Monopoly during the Second World War.In his article about Monopoly, Ben Macintyre states that the special sets of Monopoly were sent to prison camps via the Red Cross. Waddingtons produced many escape aids which were sent to the Nazi prison camps, but these were always sent via private, often fictitious, organisations like the Licensed Victuallers Prisoner Relief Fund. No escape aids were enclosed in the Red Cross parcels, so that the Germans would have no justification for stopping these much needed parcels from reaching the prisoners.It is untrue that safe houses were shown on the maps, as there was a virtual certainty that some of the maps would fall into German hands â€” the Germans were not fools when it came to tracking down prisonersâ€™ ruses.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/war-games-3/,"monopoly, parker brothers",snopes,us,,,,

Some of those who did venture a click had their computers taken over by a series of highly objectionable images while malware simultaneously attempted to install itself onto their computers.The claim that Facebook would be initiating user charges was but the bait to lure people to the protest page and its hidden malicious payload; there are no plans afoot to require payment from those who use the site. Regarding the issue of whether Facebook would ever charge users for its social networking services, that companyâ€™s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in an April 2009 Business Week interview that: â€œThe answer is no, we are not planning on charging a basic fee for our basic services. Once again, that question stems from people thinking weâ€™re growing so quickly, weâ€™re running out of money. Weâ€™re growing really quickly, but we can finance that growth. Weâ€™re not going to charge for our basic services.â€eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_2']));In their Help Center section, the social network says in answer to the query â€œWill Facebook ever charge for service?â€ quite plainly â€œNo. We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.â€In early July 2011, the spread of yet another â€œFacebook is about to start charging its usersâ€ canard (driven by a fictional Weekly World News article) was fueled by the promise contained in that version of the hoax that users who posted the rumor as their status would be spared the levy. Those who attempted to exempt themselves from the charge thereby spread the lie even further, thus doing the leg work of the hoaxsters. (The logical disconnect of the practical joke seemed to evade many: If Facebook were bent upon extracting fees from its users, why would it choose to exempt any of them?)In late September 2011, the â€œpost as your status to get out of being charged and make the icon turn blueâ€ hoax ran rampant yet again, this time accompanied by claims that Facebook would be implementing a tiered membership system. The same hoax reappeared in May 2012 and again in July 2013.In September 2014 the fake news site National Report piled on to this tired hoax meme by publishing a fictitious article positing that Facebook would begin charging users $2.99 per month starting 1 November 2014:At a press conference this morning, Facebook rolled out their new monthly service plan which begins November 1st of this year. The social media giant says they will start charging members $2.99/mo to use the services that the site has to offer.â€œAfter thinking long and hard about this decision, at the end of the day, we were forced to add this monthly fee,â€ Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters. â€œIf we donâ€™t do something about our rising costs now, Facebook could cease to exist in the near future.â€As of September 2017 the hoax remained in broad circulation via Facebook. A version attributed to â€œMark, the Director of Facebookâ€ suggested that it â€œseems that all the warnings are realâ€ and â€œFacebook use will cost moneyâ€:Iâ€™m Mark, the Director of Facebook.

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINA â€œproposed 28th Amendmentâ€ to the U.S. Constitution  (now circulated in modified form as the â€œCongressional Reform Act of 2017â€) is several years old, has nothing to do with American business magnate Warren Buffett, and has not been proposed or submitted by any member of the U.S. Congress or by President Trump:Warren Buffett is asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise. In three days, most people in the United States will have the message. This is an idea that should be passed around.For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea that Congressmembers could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they didnâ€™t pay into Social Security, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered â€” in all of its forms.Somehow, that doesnâ€™t seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law. I truly donâ€™t care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop. This is a good way to do that. It is an idea whose time has come.Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:â€œCongress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the United States.â€Each person contact a minimum of Twenty people on their Address list, in turn ask each of those to do likewise.Then in three days, all people in The United States of America will have the Message. This is one proposal that really should be passed around.This is a great idea.

The Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work.Although this item could be said to have no real â€œtrueâ€ or â€œfalseâ€ quality to it (since what it references is just a hypothetical proposal and not a real piece of legislation), all of the supporting arguments accompanying it are false, and the answers to common questions asked about it are all nearly all negative:Is this [text] the actual 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution?eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));No. The U.S. Constitution has only 27 amendments, the last of which (a limit on Congressional pay increases) was ratified in 1992.Is this [text] really the proposed 28th Amendment?This item is a â€œproposed 28th amendmentâ€ in the very loose sense that any change to the U.S. Constitution suggested since the ratification of the 27th Amendment is a â€œproposed 28th Amendment.â€ However, when this piece hit the Internet back in 2009 it was just a bit of Internet-based politicking, not something that had been introduced or proposed as a potential amendment by any current member of Congress.In August 2013, nearly four years after this item began making the rounds on the Internet, two Congressmen (Ron DeSantis of Florida and Matt Salmon of Arizona) did introduce a joint resolution (H.J.RES.55) similar to one of its elements, proposing an amendment to the Constitution stating that â€œCongress shall make no law respecting the citizens of the United States that does not also apply to the Senators and Representatives.â€ That bill died in committee, and it is exceedingly unlikely that any such broadly worded amendment could ever pass muster in Congress without the underlying idea being subject to a good many qualifications.Could this amendment be passed without Congress voting on it?Yes and no. Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution specifies two procedures for amendments. One method is for two-thirds of states legislatures to call for a constitutional convention at which new amendments may be proposed, subject to ratification by three-fourths of the states. The constitutional convention method allows for the Constitution to be amended by the actions of states alone and cuts Congress out of the equation â€” no Congressional vote or approval is required. However, not once in the history of the United States have the states ever called a convention for the purpose of proposing new constitutional amendments.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));The other method for amending the Constitution (the one employed with every amendment so far proposed or enacted) requires that the proposed amendment be approved by both houses of Congress (i.e., the Senate and the House of Representatives) by a two-thirds majority in each, and then ratified by three-fourths of the states. Itâ€™s probably safe to speculate that the odds that a supermajority of both houses of Congress would pass an amendment which placed such restrictions upon them are very low indeed.Can members of Congress retire with full pay after serving only a single term?No. This is a long-standing erroneous rumor which we cover in a separate article.Are members of Congress exempt from paying into Social Security?No. As noted in our article about Congressional pensions, although Congress initially participated in the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) rather than Social Security, since 1984 all members of Congress have been required to pay into the Social Security fund.Are members of Congress exempt from prosecution for sexual harassment?eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content-1000002','ezslot_6']));No. The passage of Public Law 104-1 (the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, also known as CAA) made a variety of laws related to civil rights and workplace regulations applicable to the legislative branch of the federal government.Section 1311(a) of the CAA specifically prohibits sexual harassment (as well as harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin).Are members of Congress exempt from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (i.e., â€œObamacareâ€) health care legislation?No. One of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by Congress is a requirement that lawmakers give up the insurance coverage previously provided to them through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and instead purchase health insurance through the online exchanges that the law created:(D) MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE EXCHANGE.(i) REQUIREMENT â€” Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are:(I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or(II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).An August 2013 ruling by the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was widely and inaccurately reported as exempting members of Congress from the requirement that they give up their Federal Employees Health Benefits Program coverage and instead purchase health insurance through online exchanges. That reporting was incorrect: Lawmakers are still required to purchase health insurance through government-created exchanges; what the OPMâ€™s ruling actually declared was that members of Congress and their staffs did not have to give up the federal subsidies covering part of the costs of their insurance premiums which they had previously been receiving (and which are afforded to millions of other federal workers).An October 2011 variant of this item is prefaced by a statement made by Warren Buffett: â€œâ€˜I could end the deficit in 5 minutes. You just pass a law that says that anytime there is a deficit of more than 3% of GDP, all sitting members of Congress are ineligible for re-election.'â€ This quote came from a 7 July 2011 CNBC interview in which the Oracle of Omaha addressed the then-current issue of raising the debt limit. The rest of the message however, has nothing to do with Warren Buffett.Some versions of this item include a statement asserting that the children and staffers of U.S. Congressmen are exempt from paying back student loan obligations.

SeeÂ Example( s )EXAMPLESCollected via e-mail, October 2009							We're hearing that college and high school aged girls are soaking tampons in vodka and inserting them in their vaginas as a new, undetectable and quick way to get drunk.  ""Ick"" factor aside, I'm wondering if it's true.  Thanks!						FalseRATINGFalseORIGINAlthough whispers about young women trying to furtively get their alcohol buzzes on by inserting vodka-soaked tampons into themselves have existed for more than fifteen years (our oldest printed reference dates to 1999, but the rumor is likely a fair bit older than that), cases documenting instances of women actually engaging in such a practice are rare to non-existent and well short of proving it to be the widespread phenomenon rumor makes it out to be.  Nonetheless, as with so many other stories about supposedly worrisome teen crazes, news outlets periodically run stories proclaiming insertion of â€œvodka tamponsâ€ to be a real and common activity, stories based on little or nothing more than mere repetition of rumor (e.g., â€œWeâ€™ve heard teens are doing thisâ€).Arguing strongly against such rumors is the nature of tampons themselves. While these cylindrical compacted wads of cotton and/or rayon do soak up liquid readily (which is their purpose, after all), they also become nigh on impossible to insert into any bodily orifice when they are in such a saturated state. Also, as blog editor Danielle Crittenden discovered when she experimented with the procedure, putting vodka into direct contact with vaginal membranes hurts like the dickens, with the pain not retreating after a few moments of discomfort but rather continuing unabated for as long as the liquor is present (and indeed well after).Crittendenâ€™s research also showed even a â€œsuper-plusâ€ tampon could absorb only 1.5 ounces of vodka, with a half ounce of that having to be wrung from it prior to insertion. The amount of alcohol therefore available to provide a buzz to thrill-seeking teens would be akin to that found in one typical mixed drink, a tipple hardly worth going to the trouble of inserting a vodka-soaked tampon into oneâ€™s nether regions even if the procedure were pain-free and could be showed to work.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph','ezslot_3']));As to why anyone would want to ingest alcohol in this fashion, three reasons are given for the purported practice: To do away with the problem of the smell of booze on oneâ€™s breath, to bypass the stomach and thus more quickly benefit from the full effect of the hooch, and to eliminate the sort of gastric distress that leaves a heavy imbiber clutching the porcelain god at 4 a.m.The most commonly-given reason, the avoidance of bowery breath, has the least going for it. If one were to ingest vodka vaginally (or anally, as the rumor is also expressed that way), the practice wouldnâ€™t result in booze-free breath because alcohol is partially expelled from the body via the lungs. Once liquor is in the blood, at least some of it gets breathed out, which is how breathalyzers measure blood alcohol content. Also, the rumorâ€™s lynchpin, that as long as a teen gal has sweet breath her parents wonâ€™t know their little darling has been tippling, isnâ€™t all that practical. Itâ€™s not easy to conceal being three sheets to the wind; drunken behavior often gives the game away long before the stink of booze does.  Any teen who thinks avoiding parental detection is nothing but a matter of masking or eliminating the scent is probably in for a rude surprise.Even if putting liquor into direct contact with the mucus membranes of the vagina or rectum worked to speed alcohol into the bloodstream, the practice might come at a cost. Such membranes are sensitive, and the potential burning discomfort of flooding those areas with John Barleycornâ€™s finest could prove memorable and not nearly adequately compensate for having advanced oneâ€™s inebriation by a matter of minutes.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));Some claim taking in vodka through the insertion of liquor-soaked tampons might (and weâ€™re not going to test this theory, so weâ€™ll leave it at â€œmightâ€) work to keep oneâ€™s dinner in place during a fierce night of partying, citing the notion it avoids the presence of large amounts of alcohol into the stomach, a presence that works to irritate the lining of that organ and thus prompt regurgitation of its contents.  (However, vomiting is one of the bodyâ€™s defense mechanisms against poisoning, so suppressing or avoiding that function is not generally a good idea.  In 2005, for example, a woman was charged with negligent homicide for administering a sherry enema that caused the death of her husband from alcohol poisoning.)  Another putative reason given for imbibing in this manner is bypassing the stomach avoids the calories associated with alcohol consumption.The rumor has become particularly attached to the Scottish rock band Mogwai. According to lore, while trapped in a European tour environment where hooch was hard to come by, the band members soaked tampons in vodka and inserted them into their rectal cavities in order to facilitate the swift and efficient entry of the small available stock of alcohol into their bloodstreams. The group maintains they never did this, and the belief they did arose from an innocent conversation with a journalist in which mere discussion of the practice was subsequently misremembered by that reporter as the groupâ€™s having claimed to have participated in the activity themselves.Sightings: Â  Vodka-soaked tampons were referenced in an episode of the television crime drama CSI (â€œTwo and a Half Deaths,â€ original air date 8 May 2008). Also, in the TV series The Girlfriendsâ€™ Guide to Divorce (â€œRule No. 67: Donâ€™t Kill the Princess,â€ original air date 13 January 2015), Lillyâ€™s14th birthday party is enlivened by the sudden cascade of her friends into the pool after vodka-soaked tampons have caused severe sensations of burning and stinging in the nether regions of the young partygoers.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/boozing-it-up/,"Kinky, tampons, vodka",snopes,us,,,,

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINThe above-displayed sign taped on the glass of a Perfume Planet store at the Harwin Central Mart in Houston, Texas, caused a great deal of consternation (and outrage) among Americans in mid-September 2009, the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.  Many viewers took the signâ€™s statement that the store would be closed on September 11 â€œto commemorate to the martyrdom of the Imam Aliâ€ as a mean-spirited insult, interpreting it to mean that the proprietors were shutting down to honor one of the terrorists killed in the perpetration of the 9/11 attacks.Although the sign was real, its common interpretation was erroneous: None of the 9/11 hijackers was named â€œAli,â€ and the word â€œImamâ€ is not a name but rather a title (akin to â€œrabbiâ€ or â€œministerâ€) that refers to a Muslim religious leader. The Imam Ali was not a modern day terrorist; he was a 7th century religious figure, the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, whom Shiâ€™a Muslims regard as the first Imam.  (Disagreement over Aliâ€™s role in Islamic theology led to the division of Muslims into the Sunni and Shiâ€™a branches of Islam.)Ali was attacked by an assassin while praying in a mosque on the 19th day of Ramadan and died two days later, so the 21st day of Ramadan is (among the Shiâ€™a branch of Islam) a day of special significance, a day for honoring the martyrdom of the Imam Ali.  Since the Islamic calendar is based on lunar months with years of 354 or 355 days, the months of the Islamic calendar move around from year to year with respect to the Gregorian calendar.  In 2009, the month of Ramadan began on 21 August, and the 21st day of Ramadan therefore coincidentally fell on the date of September 11 by the Gregorian calendar that year.The Perfume Planetâ€™s manager explained his reaction to the confusion caused by the controversial signage:Store manager Imran Chunawala was stunned [by the reaction] because the holiday had nothing to do with 9/11.Then he realized what happened. Imam Ali died on the 21st day of Ramadan in the year 661 AD. Itâ€™s a somber and significant holy day for Muslims. This year it coincidentally fell on September 11.â€œWe did not explain enough in the sign because that is the same sign we put up every year on this particular day for this particular reason,â€ said Chunawala.He apologized for the confusion and put up a new sign thoroughly explaining the martyr they were honoring died in 661 AD.â€œIf people thought that thatâ€™s what this was about, I apologize,â€ Chunawala said. â€œThat was not what this was about.

FalseRATINGFalseORIGINThe above-linked video has been circulating since 2009 and is variously reported as an audition for the television show Armeniaâ€™s Got Talent, Polandâ€™s Got Talent, or Russiaâ€™s Got Talent gone horribly wrong, a haplessly comedic â€œWilliam Tellâ€ act that ends with one participant taking an arrow straight through the head.  No program by any of those names exists, however, and the set shown in the video curiously features only generic signs and props reading â€œTalentâ€ in English: no fuller program name is displayed, no signage bearing anything written in the language of the country in which this program supposedly aired is evident, and no one in the clip speaks a word of dialogue.  (A briefly-displayed overlay in Cyrillic lettering identifies the clip as featuring the â€œAmazing Brothers.â€)The video can be pegged as fake for a number of reasons, chief among them that if such a horrible accident had truly occurred during the recording of a television show, it would not have been broadcast, so weâ€™d expect to be viewing the action â€œrawâ€ as captured by a single camera.  Yet the clip has obviously been cleanly edited (to include cuts to the judgesâ€™ reactions) and has been subject to post-production (to add graphic overlays), simulating the appearance of something that was prepared or aired as part of a finished program.

UnprovenRATINGUnprovenORIGINOn 10 November 2016, journalist Dan Arel published a tweet claiming Donald Trump had won the state of Wisconsin by 27,000 votes, adding that 300,000 Wisconsin voters were â€œturned awayâ€ by the stateâ€™s voter identification laws:Trump won Wisconsin by 27,000 votes.300,000 voters were turned away by the states strict Voter ID law.There is your â€œriggedâ€ election.â€” Dan Arel (@danarel) November 10, 2016Many social media users sought citations for both claims (one involving the margin of Trumpâ€™s Wisconsin victory, and the other the number of voters purportedly turned away). As of 14 November 2016, Trumpâ€™s votes in Wisconsin were tallied at 1,409,427 to Hillary Clintonâ€™s 1,382,210 (a margin of 27,257 votes):  eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));That figure made it into a New York Times articleÂ about voter identification laws and their effects on voting outcomes, but the far more attention-grabbing 300,000 voters being denied at the polls partÂ did not. When asked aboutÂ a source for those numbers, Arel tweeted: @SpartaDTD Not sure if I replied to you or not yet. https://t.co/O6gCIiD82W â€” Dan Arel (@danarel) November 10, 20162nd paragraph. 3000,000 voters lacked the necessary ID.You read like you vote. https://t.co/qlBNsXpOOXâ€” Dan Arel (@danarel) November 10, 2016The article Arel cited claimed that:Weâ€™ll likely never know how many people were kept from the polls by restrictions like voter-ID laws, cuts to early voting, and barriers to voter registration. But at the very least this should have been a question that many more people were looking into. For example, 27,000 votes currently separate Trump and Clinton in Wisconsin, where 300,000 registered voters, according to a federal court, lacked strict forms of voter ID. Voter turnout in Wisconsin was at its lowest levels in 20 years and decreased 13 percent in Milwaukee, where 70 percent of the stateâ€™s African-American population lives, according to Daniel Nichanian of the University of Chicago. I documented stories of voters in Wisconsinâ€”including a 99-year-old manâ€”who made two trips to the polls and one to the DMV on Election Day just to be able to vote, while others decided not to vote at all because they were denied IDs.Â eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));The piece in turn linked to a 29 September 2016 article on the same web site about theÂ difficulty ofÂ obtaining voter identificationÂ in the state of Wisconsin, but nowhere in that articleÂ did the 300,000 number appear. A second link led to a 29 April 2014 WisconsinÂ court ruling againstÂ voter ID laws:For the reasons stated, IT IS ORDERED that the named Defendants and Defendantsâ€™ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and all those acting in concert or participation with them, or having actual or implicit knowledge of this Order by personal service or otherwise, are hereby permanently enjoined from conditioning a personâ€™s access to a ballot, either in-person or absentee, on that personâ€™s presenting a form of photo identification.A section of that ruling gauged that roughly 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin did not possess sufficient identification to vote at the time that the ruling was issued in April 2014, but it did not suggest that all 300,000 had tried and failed to vote at any point:In light of the fact that a substantial number of the 300,000 plus voters who lack an ID are low income, Act 23â€™s burdens must be assessed with reference to them rather than with reference to a typical middle- or upper-class voter. Although the latter voter may have little trouble obtaining an ID, he or she is not the type of voter who will need to obtain one in order to comply with Act 23. Thus, in the discussion that follows, I identify the burdens associated with obtaining a qualifying photo ID and explain how they will impact low-income voters.Given the obstacles identified above, it is likely that a substantial number of the 300,000 plus voters who lack a qualifying ID will be deterred from voting. Although not every voter will face all of these obstacles, many voters will face some of them, particularly those who are low income. And the evidence at trial showed that even small obstacles will be enough to deter many individuals who lack an ID from voting.Â The courts found not that 300,000 people were actively â€œturned awayâ€ as of April 2014, but rather that that number of registered voters possibly faced what the court deemed to be undue burdens obtaining the necessary identification to vote:Â There is no way to determine exactly how many people Act 23 will prevent or deter from voting without considering the individual circumstances of each of the 300,000 plus citizens who lack an ID. But no matter how imprecise my estimate may be, it is absolutely clear that Act23 will prevent more legitimate votes from being cast than fraudulent votes.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content-1000002','ezslot_6']));On 26 October 2016, the New York Times provided updated information about voter ID laws in Wisconsin. Although some barriers to voting remain, the paper found manyÂ of the controversial provisions had been overturned:It seemed a clear victory for voting rights advocates in July when a federal court invalidated much of Wisconsinâ€™s restrictive elections law, concluding that it discriminated against minorities by requiring voters to produce photo identification cards that blacks and Latinos too often lack. The remedy was straightforward: Henceforth, the state was to â€œpromptly issue a credential valid as a voting ID to any personâ€ who applied for one.But this month when Treasure Collins visited one of the Wisconsin motor vehicle offices that issue IDs, she found something entirely different.â€œI brought everything my mom told me I would need: my school ID, a copy of my birth certificate, my Social Security number,â€ said Ms. Collins, 18. â€œBut they told me I needed an original copy of my birth certificate. An original copy, all the way from Illinois.â€While Donald J. Trump repeatedly claims that the election is â€œriggedâ€ against him, voting rights groups are increasingly battling something more concrete in this yearâ€™s ferocious wars over access to the ballot box: Despite a string of court victories against restrictive voting laws passed by Republican legislatures, even when voting rights groups win in court, they are at risk of losing on the ground.The 300,000 figure originated with a courtâ€™s estimate of how many voters were potentially impacted by a voter ID law as it stood in April 2014, but by October 2016, changes had been made to that law. Moreover, even if the 300,000 figure wasÂ an accurate estimate of Wisconsin residents who back in 2014 possibly could not vote because they did not have the correct identification, that number was notÂ a head count of residents who actually did (or would have) set out to vote on 8 November 2016 only to be turned away.",unproven,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/300000-wisconsin-voters-turned-away-due-to-voter-id-laws/,"300000 wisconsin voters, donald trump, voter fraud, voter ID, voter suppression, wisconsin",snopes,us,,,,

TrueRATINGTrueORIGINIn 2015, a controversy erupted in the small English town of Malvern that went global when the town council removed a specially made, star-shaped headstone that had placed on the grave of a child. The headstone for 4-year-old Max Corbett-GardenerÂ featured a gray-colored Teddy bear holding a black star, and according to the BBC, it was removed three days after it was erected over complaints that its shape did not confirm to cemetery rules:â€œWe have a conformity of shapes in our lawn cemetery,â€ the council said. â€œWe were contacted by people who objected to the shape. The longer it stayed up, the harder the process would have been.â€œIt was a very difficult decision to remove it but one we had to make straight away.â€Max died due to complications associated with severe epilepsy in 2013, and two years later his mother, Jo Corbett-Gardener, had the custom gravestone made to commemorate what would have been his 7th birthday. She told the BBC in a 5 June 2015 report that she wasnâ€™t informed that a decision had been made to remove the memorial:Ms Corbett said she was aware of council rules governing the size and upkeep of stones, but not regarding their shape.She said she had been told the grave would have been allowed if it had been in the childrenâ€™s section of Great Malvern Cemetery, but she had opted to have it in the lawn cemetery, close to other relatives.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));It remains unclear who issued the complaint(s) that resulted in the headstoneâ€™s removal: a cold-hearted private citizen, as many headlines implied, or by town officials. According to local reports, the town council blamed the stonemason who installed the headstone, saying he didnâ€™t secure proper permits:Regrettably, the memorial stone that was erected on Ms Corbettâ€™s sonâ€™s grave was done so by a memorial mason who did not obtain the necessary permission, and who did not consult with town council officers as to whether the headstone was in compliance with the cemetery rules and regulations.This situation was not the fault of Ms Corbett, but of the stonemason who made a gravestone that was unsuitable for the position in which it was to be erected, and which was also put in place without the necessary permission; the application form was posted under the door of the town council offices just hours before the stone was erected.Corbett-Gardener launched an online petition in hopes of having the custom-made marker returned, and as of 26 December 2016 it had garnered more than 56,000 signatures.The tragedy of a young childâ€™s death, coupled with the outrage factor of the removal of his innocuous memorial, has spread the story far beyond the confines of tiny Malvern. Since it was first published in June 2015, the story has continued to make its way around many corners of the online world.We have reached out to the Malvern town council but have not yet heard back.",TRUE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-boys-headstone-removed-single-complaint/,cemetery,snopes,us,,,,

War Two, singer Edith Piaf helped 120 prisoners of war escape from Nazi camps by fabricating phoney identity cards for them.","CLAIM					During World War Two, singer Edith Piaf helped 120 prisoners of war escape from Nazi camps by fabricating phoney identity cards for them.									UnprovenRATINGUnprovenORIGINAn old story about Edith Piaf got a new lease of life in October 2017, when a web site devoted to â€œpositive and meaningful contentâ€ produced a short video recounting the iconic French singerâ€™s purported heroism during World War Two.Â On 17 October, Fabiosa Australia posted an animated video to its Facebook page, telling the followingÂ story:In 1944, Edith Piaf was invited to speak before captured French prisoners in a German concentration camp. At first, she didnâ€™t want to do it. But then she agreed. After the speech, she asked that a photo be taken as a memento of her with the prisoners of war. When she arrived back home, she enlarged the photograph. She cut out all 120 faces from the photo and ordered 120 fake passports.Â When she returned to perform a concert at the same camp, she brought the passports in a suitcase with a double bottom. While signing autographs, she gave the passports to the prisoners. All 120 prisoners managed to escape and be saved.Neither the video nor the accompanying Facebook post provides any source, but this is an old tale that has been modified and embellished over the decades. According to one source, Piaf saved â€œthousandsâ€ of Jews (not 120) from the Nazi camps, and inÂ another iterationÂ it was the prisoners themselves who made their own fake IDs.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));According to Carolyn Burkeâ€™s 2011 biography of Piaf, she used a seven-week tour of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany as a way to help carry out a mission for her secretary AndrÃ©e â€œDÃ©dÃ©eâ€ Bigard, who was part of the anti-Nazi Resistance movement:The newspapers documented the tour with photos of Edith sharing conditions at the stalags [prisoner-of-war camps]â€¦but there was no record of her many photographs with the prisoners, taken as souvenirs of her visit.Â Shortly after her return home from Germany, according to Burke, Piaf was â€œalready planning her next trip thereâ€:DÃ©dÃ©eâ€™s Resistance group was preparing false identity cards made with the enlarged faces from her souvenir photos; Edith was to distribute them, along with supplies to help the prisoners escapeâ€¦Accompanied by her orchestra, a humorist, a dancer and an actor named Robert Dalban, Edith and DÃ©dÃ©e left for Berlin in February [1944] with the fake identity cards concealed in their suitcases.Â According to later interviews given by Bigard, Piaf visited 11 stalags on that trip to Germany andâ€” in Burkeâ€™s wordsÂ â€” distributed â€œidentity cards, maps and compasses. Sometimes the escaped prisoners caught up with her tour and were passed off as musicians.â€ The mission was ended when officials at one of the camps became suspicious.Â In French journalist Robert Belleretâ€™s biographyÂ Piaf, un Mythe FranÃ§ais, AndrÃ©e Bigard is quoted as saying that the singer had been part of a â€œResistance networkâ€:A mission was entrusted to me, which consisted of helping French prisoners who were working in the camps to escape from Germany. Fake identity cards were made and slipped into cans of food along with a map of the area and a tiny compass.Â On the day, we went to a certain spot, found our escapees and returned to France with a few more musicians than when we had set out. We made several journeys like this, but the German authorities ended up getting suspicious because the prisoners kept going missing after Mademoiselle Piafâ€™s visits.Â eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));After the liberation of France by the Allies, and the end of World War Two, France underwent what was known as the â€œÃ‰puration Sauvageâ€ (the â€œWild Purgeâ€)Â â€” essentially a period of informal and often brutal revenge against those who had aided the Nazis in their annexation of France.According to the political scientist Michael Curtis, between 9,000 and 10,000 suspected collaborationists were killed. After this, official tribunals were set up and a period known as the â€œÃ‰puration Legaleâ€ (the â€œLegal Purgeâ€) ensued. Tens of thousands of people were jailed, 6,763 were sentenced to death, and 768 of these were executed.Â Edith Piaf was believed by some to have been a collaborator, due to her tours of prisoner-of-war camps and participation in Nazi propaganda efforts, and she was called to testify before a tribunal with a focus on French artists.According to Carolyn Burke, the tribunal had included her name in a list of musicians whose voice was to be banned from French radio, something that would have been a significant blow to her career. However, she testified that her first trip to Germany was made under coercion, and the second one was undertaken for the true purpose of giving prisoners money and helping them escape.AndrÃ©e Bigard backed up Piafâ€™s account, and the singer was cleared. Shortly after her testimony in October 1944, she gave an interview to theÂ Ce SoirÂ newspaper, in which she provided the now famous number of 118 soldiers having been saved by her actions, and remarked:Â I tried to navigate the pitfalls of Nazi propaganda, while also maintaining the trust of the French public.Â eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content-1000002','ezslot_6']));However, Robert Belleret casts doubt on this version of events, pointing out implausibilities and inconsistencies in the accountÂ  and suggesting that the story might have been concocted so as to justify Piafâ€™s visits to Germany (which were intended and used by the Nazis as propaganda in Vichy France), and to save herself from the wrath of the tribunals:Â â€¦Such an operation, worthy of a novel or a scene from the Great Escapeâ€¦ would require a certain audacity and activist commitment to which the singer was not accustomed. Besides, in referring to â€œseveral trips,â€ [AndrÃ©e Bigard] suggests that Piaf made frequent return journeys to Germany, which does not correspond to the truth.Â Above all, this glorious claim clashes with a piece of factual evidence: when Piaf made her first trip to Germany, she definitely didnâ€™t imagine she would be making a second. So for what reason, then, were those photoshoots set up?Â Finally, if these acts of resistance were proven, itâ€™s hard to see why they wouldnâ€™t have been revealed by one of the prisoners who escaped thanks to her. â€œI owe my freedom to Edith Piafâ€ â€“ you can only imagine the headlinesâ€¦.But, despite Piafâ€™s claim in a newspaper [Ce Soir] about 118 successful escapes thanks to â€œherâ€ fake identity cards, not a single testimony from an escapee corroborating these statements has ever appeared in public. Robert Dalban, an actor and firsthand witness to the tour [of Germany] has never mentioned any such mission.Â Belleret lists some of the purported details of Piafâ€™s efforts to help Jewish people (sending them money and housing them) during the Nazi occupation, but notes that these names and numbers were provided by Piaf herself and her loyal secretary AndrÃ©e Bigard, and that they could not be verified.Â Carolyn Burkeâ€™s biography, which casts a less skeptical and more positive light on Edith Piaf, also does not contain corroborating evidence (that is, evidence provided by someone other than Piaf or Bigard).

This tale also bore a very strong resemblance to previous hoaxes, particularly one about a Chinese man who supposedly sued his wife for bearing him ugly children after he discovered she had undergone extensive cosmetic surgery prior to meeting him to disguise her less-than-desirable looks.Indeed, the story was a jape perpetrated by the French-language fake news web site El Manchar (i.e., â€œThe Stainâ€), who proudly tweeted about how their fabricated story had made the listing of the dayâ€™s top news stories:Le canular sur le maquillage parmi les sujets d'actualitÃ© les plus repris au monde pic.twitter.com/tNkEhkeJtAâ€” el-manchar (@el_manchar) August 6, 2015The Middle Eastern news site Gulf News ran virtually the same article in October 2016, which was picked up and repeated as fact by other online news outlets such as the UKâ€™s Metro:Just days after her marriage, an Arab bride was dumped by her husband after he saw her with no make-up, said a psychologist who counselled the unidentified woman.The 34-year-old Arab groom divorced his 28-year-old bride, said the doctor, because the husband believed she did not look as pretty as before the wedding and accused her of deceiving him by using so many cosmetics, including fake eyelashes.Dr Abdul Aziz Asaf, consultant psychologist, told Gulf News that his clinic received a request from the woman to help her overcome her psychological suffering after her divorce.Dr Asaf did not reveal the womanâ€™s identity for reasons of confidentiality.Gulf News has learnt that the groom took his bride to Al Mamzar Beach for a leisurely swim but the outing turned tragic when her face became wet and her makeup reportedly washed away.The groom said he could not recognise his wife after the make-up was gone.The bride wore artificial eyelashes and had undergone cosmetic surgeries before the marriage.The coupleâ€™s engagement lasted for six months.Dr Asaf said the bride told him that she intended to tell her husband the truth about her but it was too late. â€œThe groom immediately divorced his bride and refused any attempt to reunite them again,â€ Dr Asaf said.",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kiss-no-makeup/,"gulf news, metro",snopes,us,,,,

Needless to say, no news reports have suggested that President Obama has any designs to do anything to the Statue of Liberty, much less plans to close or remove it.The rumor wasnâ€™t new in July 2016, as a few months earlier the web site Departed.co published the same article verbatim and also asserted that the President had made such a claim on â€œMonday.â€ As it turned out, the sentence was a snippet taken from a 30 September 2013 CNSNews article which itself misleadingly presented President Obamaâ€™s comments on a looming government shutdown:  President Barack Obama warned late Monday afternoon that if the House of Representatives did not agree to a continuing resolution to fund the government after midnight that did not curtail the implementation of Obamacare â€” and that he would therefore agree to sign â€” the Statue of Liberty would be â€œimmediately closed.â€At the same time, Obama conceded that even if the House refused to pass a CR that allowed the administation to move forward with Obamacare, major government programs would continue. Social Security and Medicare, for example, would go on, and U.S. troops would remain on duty.The linked remarks made by President Obama described the consequences of a government shutdown, not a personal plan of his to do away with the Statue of Liberty:With regard to operations that will continue: If youâ€™re on Social Security, you will keep receiving your checks. If youâ€™re on Medicare, your doctor will still see you. Everyoneâ€™s mail will still be delivered. And government operations related to national security or public safety will go on. Our troops will continue to serve with skill, honor, and courage. Air traffic controllers, prison guards, those who are with border control â€” our Border Patrol will remain on their posts, but their paychecks will be delayed until the government reopens. NASA will shut down almost entirely, but Mission Control will remain open to support the astronauts serving on the Space Station.I also want to be very clear about what would change. Office buildings would close. Paychecks would be delayed. Vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung. Business owners would see delays in raising capital, seeking infrastructure permits, or rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. Veterans whoâ€™ve sacrificed for their country will find their support centers unstaffed. Tourists will find every one of Americaâ€™s national parks and monuments, from Yosemite to the Smithsonian to the Statue of Liberty, immediately closed. And of course, the communities and small businesses that rely on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out of customers and out of luck.And in keeping with the broad ramifications of a shutdown, I think itâ€™s important that everybody understand the federal government is Americaâ€™s largest employer. More than 2 million civilian workers and 1.4 million active-duty military serve in all 50 states and all around the world. In the event of a government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of these dedicated public servants who stay on the job will do so without pay â€” and several hundred thousand more will be immediately and indefinitely furloughed without pay.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));These comments were completely unrelated to Muslims and did not single out the Statue of Liberty.

Darlymple truly had given someone a â€œgreen lightâ€ to shoot protesters â€œon sight,â€ itâ€™s highly unlikely that the only source reporting this news would be a private Facebook group and an obscure blog.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Anarchicnewsâ€™ reporting is also discredited by the fact that indigenous people are still actively protesting the pipeline, in clear view of authorities, yet none of them has been taken out by forces allegedly told to â€œshoot [them] on sight.â€Governor Dalrymple declared a state of emergency in North Dakota to deal with the pipeline protests on 19 August 2016, proclaiming that the main goals behind his declaration were to ensure the safety of law enforcement, the general public, and the protesters:Gov. Jack Dalrymple today authorized a restricted emergency declaration, making available additional state resources which may be needed to manage public safety risks associated with the ongoing protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline near Cannon Ball.The Governorâ€™s executive order does not include activation of the North Dakota National Guard, but makes available other state resources for the purpose of protecting the health, safety and well-being of the general public and those involved in the protest. The executive order can help the state and local agencies manage costs associated with providing a heightened law enforcement presence and activates the State Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate the efficient flow of resources.â€œThe State of North Dakota remains committed to protecting citizensâ€™ rights to lawfully assemble and protest, but the unfortunate fact remains that unlawful acts associated with the protest near Cannon Ball have led to serious public safety concerns and property damage,â€ Gov. Dalrymple said. â€œThis emergency declaration simply allows us to bring greater resources to bear if needed to help local officials address any further public safety concerns.â€",FALSE,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/north-dakota-shoot-protesters/,"native americans, north dakota, pipeline",snopes,us,,,,

BACON! How can you have a delicious BACON CHEESEBURGER WITHOUT BACON? Well, you canâ€™t.Thatâ€™s right folks, the fast food chain will now be able to feed terrorists without having to worry about being decapitated.The move is part of Burger Kingâ€™s attempt to compete with McDonaldâ€™s who are the biggest player in the fast food industry across France. McDonaldâ€™s has about 1,300 stores.This is all about the almighty dollar folks. Plain and simple.Several of the auto-tweets about this issue were appended with â€œBREAKING,â€ as if the news were very recent and extremely relevant.Â The Political Insiderâ€˜s take was titled â€œBurger King Just Announced THEY WILL FOLLOW ISLAMIC SHARIA LAW! â€” Stop Them!â€ and stated:Burger King has caved to the pressure from Islam, and they just made an announcement that they will ONLY serve 100% halal meat, under the rules of Sharia Law.The announcement comes from their chains in France, which is the same country that recently suffered from a deadly Islamic terrorist attack just one month ago.This rule also means their French stores wonâ€™t serve bacon or chicken â€¦ The Islamification of the West is spreading, and they are demanding we all live by their rules!eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Most iterations citedÂ an article from the disreputable WND web site titled â€œForsakinâ€™ Bacon: Burger King Chooses Islamic Food Rules:Â 40 Newly Acquired Restaurants to Eliminate Pork.â€ The articles all eventually mentioned that what they were writing about in regards to Burger King only applied to France (and did not involve American franchises), but the rumor was spread on social media with no such distinction, and many tweets referenced Burger King in the United States.WND cited a 15 December 2015 from the English-language French news siteÂ TheLocal.fr titled â€œBurger King â€˜To Corner Franceâ€™s Halal Market, which reported that:US fast food giant Burger King, which has taken over the chain Quick in France, is to leave around 40 stores under the original name, which will be turned into â€œ100 percent halalâ€ fast food outlets, according to reports.French competition authorities last week gave the green light for Burger Kingâ€™s takeover of the 405 outlets of Quick in FranceÂ â€¦Â Burger King is reportedly going to keep around 40 stores under the name Quick â€” around ten percent of the total in France â€” and switch their meat so it is entirely halal, the paper reported.This means all bacon and pork-based meals will be scrapped from the menu and all the beef and chicken used will be certified halal.Admittedly, that reporting was slightly ambiguous: it wasnâ€™t clear whether Burger King would operate halal-friendly Burger King locations or just fold the Quick brand into their own and maintain halal-friendly Quick locations. A less sensational take was published by food and restaurant blog Grub Street, who noted:Franceâ€™s imitation Beurger King Muslim restaurant better prepare for some stiff competition from none other than the King himself. Burger King just bought a French rival named Quick, so it can go harder in France (there are only about 30 stores right now), and the big strategy apparently involves interesting plans for a portion of Quickâ€™s 405 outlets.La Parisien reports that 40 of them will remain Quicks, but their menus will become â€œ100 percent halalâ€ to cater to Franceâ€™s booming Muslim population, one of Europeâ€™s largest.So not only did no â€œannouncementâ€ about â€œgoing halalâ€ (which was commonly and inaccurately described as â€œbowing down to Sharia lawâ€) come from Burger King in the U.S., it didnâ€™t even seem thatÂ Franceâ€˜s Burger King restaurants were converting to halal-only cuisine. Burger King apparently purchased a chain called Quick and plans to keep 40 of that chainâ€™s restaurants halal (rather than jeopardize the availability of Whoppers with bacon). Another common insinuation that Burger King (or a variety of other businesses) offered halal menus under pressure or threat from Muslims was wrong: credible reporting on such business decisions accurately describe those modifications as voluntary choices made with market share and the financial bottom line in mind. No one asked or forced Burger King to offer halal food at Quick outlets in France, but business in areas with high Muslim populations do better by providing halal options, just as many food producers choose to cater to Jewish customers with kosher offerings.We contacted the Burger Kingâ€™s U.S. media relations division for clarification on the rumors and will update this article if we receive a reply.",mostly false,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/burger-king-sharia-law/,"burger king, halal, islam",snopes,us,,,,

These photographs comeÂ from a number ofÂ sources, but at least oneÂ of them wasÂ taken from a 2012Â marketing stunt for the video gameÂ Resident Evil 6,Â in which a butcher shop selling fake â€œhuman meatâ€ was set up at Londonâ€™s Smithfield Market:Capcom is sponsoring an art installation in East London. That sounds innocuous, except that said art installation is at the Smithfield Meat Market, and is called â€œWesker & Son Resident Evil Human Butchery.â€Well, thatâ€™s certainly one way to get attention for next weekâ€™s release of Resident Evil 6.The meat market is not, of course, selling actual human meat, but they are selling meat, mostly pork varieties, rather disturbingly shaped to resemble humans. Along with a variety of human ears, hands, feet, and heads, brave consumers can also purchase carefully recreated sausage fingers and, yes, phalluses.This rumor has been reported by several disreputable web sites which often truck in unverified or hoax â€œnewsâ€ stories, such asÂ TuneZNG, Information Hood,Â andÂ Nairaland.

Â However, making any blanket assumptions or generalizations about China and its food industry is problematic and ultimately meaningless, because as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration itself points out, China is an enormous country with a wildly diverse array of suppliers and consumers:Making generalizations about Chinaâ€™s food industry is difficult. Several thousand modern, large-scale, multinational and joint venture companies and farms that use best practices and sophisticated equipment operate alongside millions of small independent farms, workshops, and merchants that use crude equipment and techniques. China has some 200 million farming households with average land holdings of 1-2 acres per farm and at least 400,000 food processing enterprises, most with 10 or fewer employees. Millions of people and businesses are involved in the handling and transportation of food beyond the farm gate.

MixtureRATINGMixtureORIGINA Facebook memeÂ making the rounds in 2017 lists several purported â€œfun factsâ€ about Social Security aimed at countering arguments that the United Statesâ€™ government-run retirement program needs toÂ be scaled back in order toÂ balance the federal budget:Social Security Fun Facts:* Social Security and Medicare are paid for with a separate tax. They add NOTHING to the national debt.* Social Security has a $2.5 trillion SURPLUS.* Congress has â€œborrowedâ€ trillions from Social Security to pay for government spending.So when the GOP says we need to cut Social Security in order to balance the federal budgetâ€¦ theyâ€™re lying.Click Yes & Share If You Want Government To Stop Messing With SS!Were it only so clear and simple. Unfortunately, many aspects of the Social Security system are misunderstood by the public and misrepresented by politicians, so it behooves us to put simplistic statements like these to the test.First, a little history: The concept of Social SecurityÂ grew out of the perceived necessity to address economic changes brought about by the industrial revolution and the increasing urbanization of American life in the early 20th century, writes former Social Security Administration (SSA) historian Larry DeWitt:Earlier forms of economic security reflected the nature of preindustrial societies. In preindustrial America, most people lived on the land (and could thus provide their own subsistence, if little else); they were self-employed as farmers, laborers, or craftsmen, and they lived in extended families that provided the main form of economic security for family members who could not work. For example, in 1880, America was still 72Â percent rural and only 28Â percent urban. In only 50Â years, that portrait changed; in 1930, we were 56Â percent urban and only 44Â percent rural (Bureau of the CensusÂ 1961).The problem of economic security in old age was not as pressing in preindustrial America because life expectancy was short. A typical American male born in 1850 had a life expectancy at birth of only 38Â years (a female, only 2Â years longer).Â But with the dawning of the twentieth century, a revolution in public sanitation, health care, and general living standards produced a growing population of Americans living into old age.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'snopes_com-under_second_paragraph-1000009','ezslot_3']));Company pensions came into existence in the late 1800s, but for most Americans working in the new industrial economy they were not an option:The biggest problem with company-provided pensions was that the percentage of workers anticipating an employment-related pension from their company or their union was tiny. Indeed, in 1900 there were a total of five companies in the United States (including Dolge) offering their industrial workers company-sponsored pensions. As late as 1932, only about 15% of the labor force had any kind of potential employment-related pension. And because the pensions were often granted or withheld at the option of the employer, most of these workers would never see a retirement pension. Indeed, only about 5% of the elderly were in fact receiving retirement pensions in 1932.The times were ripe for â€œnew forms of social provision,â€ writes DeWitt. National social insurance was an idea Europeans were already experimenting with by the 1880s, though it took the United States another fifty years to jump on the bandwagon, first in the form of some experimental state initiatives enacted between 1930 and 1935, then finally on the federal level with the passageÂ of the Social Security Act of 1935.Per the wishes of its greatest champion, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Social Security was conceived from the outset as aÂ self-financing program:On the financing issue, President Roosevelt insisted that the program be self-supporting, in the sense that all of its financing must come from its dedicated payroll taxes and not from general government revenues. He viewed the idea of using general revenues as tantamount to a â€œblank checkâ€ that would allow lawmakers to engage in unbridled spending, and he feared it would inevitably lead to unfunded future deficits. By tying expenditures to a dedicated revenue source, the program could never spend more than it could accrue through payroll taxation.However, there are a couple of well-known problems with the start-up of all pension schemes. Typically, pension system costs are lowest in the early days when few participants have retired and much higher later on when more people qualify for benefits. Funding a pension system on a current-cost basis thus would impose significantly higher taxes on future cohorts of beneficiaries. To offset this tendency, the CES planners proposed using a large reserve fund that could be used to generate investment income thereby meeting a portion of future program costs.Thus were born the Social Security trust funds, into which all program revenues go and out of which, by law, only benefits and administrative costs can be taken, with one important exception: any surpluses are to be invested in U.S. Treasury bonds, thereby accumulating interest revenue for the program and making the surpluses available for general use by the government.Â eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-mid_content-1000003','ezslot_4']));After 80-plus years, the system remains largely self-sustaining, though that cannot continue to be the case unless some major adjustments are made. What beganÂ as a contributory retirement insurance program offering minimal old-age assistance to barely half of the existing workforce has grown into a massive provider of retirement and disability benefits to more than 90 percent of American workers and their dependents. An estimated 65.1 million people received payments from the Social Security Administration in 2015. A total of $897.1 billion was distributed, an amount equivalent to 5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (for comparison, U.S. military spending was about $598 billion in 2015).The 2016 Trust Fund Trustees ReportÂ bluntly questions Social Securityâ€™s long-term sustainability:The 2016 Trustees Report projects that the number of retired workers will grow rapidly, asmembers of the post-World War II baby boom continue to retire in increasing numbers. The number of retired workers is projected to double in about 50 years. People are also living longer, and the birth rate is low. As a result, the Trustees project that the ratio of 2.8 workers paying Social Security taxes to each person collecting benefits in 2015 will fall to 2.1 to 1 in 2037.â€¦ Social Security is not sustainable over the long term at current benefit and tax rates. In 2010, the program paid more in benefits and expenses than it collected in taxes and other noninterest income, and the 2016 Trustees Report projects this pattern to continue for the next 75 years. The Trustees estimate that the combined OASI and DI trust fund reserves will be depleted by 2034.Members of both the Republican and Democratic parties have called for reform of the Social Security system to rescue it before the reserves run out. In December 2016, House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Sam Johnson (R-Texas) introduced aÂ billÂ to â€œmodernizeâ€ and â€œpermanently saveâ€ Social Security via measures such as changing how benefits are calculated, updating the definition of â€œfull retirement age,â€ and cutting back on payouts to dependents of higher-income workers.Other politicians (mainly Republicans) say Social Security cutbacks are necessary to â€œbalance the federal budgetâ€ â€”Â a claim the â€œfun factsâ€ meme we introduced at the beginning of our article is supposed to disprove, beginning with the first item:CLAIM: Social Security and Medicare are paid for with a separate tax. They add nothing to the national debt.eval(ez_write_tag([[728,90],'snopes_com-long_content-1000002','ezslot_6']));Mostly true. Social Security is and always has been a self-financing system, using payroll tax revenues, income tax on benefits, and interest on Treasury bonds to balance its budget. In terms of overall federal spending, itâ€™s an â€œoff-budgetâ€ item, which is to say, separate from the general budget, which is made up of discretionary items like military expenditures.(Medicare, which is partly self-financing, partly reliant on premiums, and partly reliant on discretionary funding from Congress, is a separate system that merits its own discussion.)Historically, Social Security hasnâ€™t always been off-budget, a fact that continues to be a source of confusion. Between 1969 and 1990, changes in the law permitted trust fund surpluses to be counted as assets when computing the federal deficit (which had the desired effect of making the deficit appear smaller than it actually was). This has not been the case since the passage of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, historian Larry DeWitt writes, but politicians still use the informal convention of including trust fund surpluses in discussions about the budget when it suits their purposes:[T]hose involved in budget matters often produce two sets of numbers, one without Social Security included in the budget totals and one with Social Security included. Thus, Social Security is still frequently treated as though it were part of the unified federal budget even though, technically, it no longer is.The fact that Social Security is off-budget and self-sustaining doesnâ€™t mean there is no interaction at all between it and the general account. Every time the trust funds purchase or redeem Treasury bonds, the two intermingle â€” a point that isnâ€™t lost on those clamoring for reform.When Social Security runs a fiscal deficit (that is, it takes in less tax money than it pays out in benefits), the shortfall has to be covered with Treasury funds, which critics say contributes to the national debt. According to the Heritage Foundationâ€™s Romina Boccia, this has been the case every year for the better part of a decade:Since 2010, the OASI program has taken in less money from payroll tax revenues and the taxation of benefits than it pays out in benefits, generating cash-flow deficits. The 2014 cash-flow deficit was $39 billion. Over the next 10 years, the OASI programâ€™s cumulative cash-flow deficit will amount to $840 billion, according to the trusteesâ€™ intermediate assumptions. For as long as the federal government is running deficits in excess of Social Securityâ€™s cash-flow deficits, we can assume that this $840 billion shortfall will be matched dollar for dollar by an increase in the public debt.But that formulation doesnâ€™t jibe with the trusteesâ€™ own recentÂ reports, according to which the programâ€™s cash flow is still in the black (and will remain so through 2019) thanks to interest income:Social Securityâ€™s total income is projected to exceed its total cost through 2019, as it has since 1982. The 2015 surplus of total income relative to cost was $23 billion.Â Even when Social Securityâ€™s cash flow does turn negative, the trustees project that the system can sustain itself for another 15 years by gradually redeeming the securities held in its trust funds. But, critics ask, doesnâ€™t the redemption of Treasury bonds impact the Treasuryâ€™s own cash flow and deepen the national debt?Yes, as to affecting the Treasuryâ€™s cash flow (but only temporarily), and no, as to deepening the national debt. Social Security Administration economist David Pattison explains:The securities that are issued to the trust funds replace securities issued to the public, and public debt â€” total Treasury securities â€” remains unchanged. The same holds in reverse forÂ OASDIÂ expenditures: Securities redeemed to cover program expenditures are replaced by securities issued to the public. When trust fund reserves grow each year, as they are doing now, increasing amounts of general account debt are shifted to trust fund holdings. When reserves are drawn down toward their longer-term levels, as will begin to occur in a few years, the general account debt held by the trust fund will once again be shifted to debt held by the public. Total general account debt â€” the gross public debt â€” is not affected by these transactions.CLAIM: Social Security has a $2.5 trillion surplus.True, and then some.Â As of 2016, Social Security Trust Fund reserves stood at $2.8 trillion, up $35 billion from the previous year. In the absence of reforms, the trustees expect to maintain surpluses, albeit gradually declining, through 2034.Â CLAIM: Congress has â€œborrowedâ€ trillions from Social Security to pay for government spending.True, but misleadingly stated.Â As we explained above, the system was set up from day one such that trust fund surplusesÂ must be invested in interest-earning U.S. Treasury bonds, in effect lending the monies to the general account for whatever discretionary uses Congress sees fit to spend them on. One might argue that there are more practical alternatives, but itâ€™s misleading to characterize it as an abuse of the system.Are members of the GOP â€œlying,â€ as the Facebook meme holds, when they say Social Security needs to be cut in order to balance the federal budget? Not necessarily, but theyâ€™re painting a distorted picture, purposely or not. In the short term, and minus the implementation of other reforms, cutting Social Security benefits would only add to the trust fundsâ€™ surpluses while cheating beneficiaries of the assistance theyâ€™ve been promised. It wouldnâ€™t add to the federal budgetâ€™s bottom line.Without question, changes of some kind will be necessary to keep Social Security viable decades hence, so thereâ€™s no way around the government â€œmessingâ€ with the system to that end, one way or another.",mixture,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/social-security-fun-facts/,"bernie sanders, Petitions, social security",snopes,us,,,,
