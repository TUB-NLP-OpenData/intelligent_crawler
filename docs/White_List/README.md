## Definition of White List

Fact Checkers on the white list are those who are signatories of the International Fact-Cheking Network (IFCN) and comply to their Code of Principles. 
The IFCN is an organisation that monitors trends in fact checking, provides training resources and hosts a yearly conference on fact checking called #GlobalFact. It aims to promote best practice in fact checking and provide a place for collaboration between fact checkers worldwide.
## IFCN Code of Principles

The Code of Principles:
1. A COMMITMENT TO NONPARTISANSHIP AND FAIRNESS
IFCN fact-checks claims using the same standard for every fact check. They do not concentrate their fact-checking on any one side. They follow the same process for every fact check and let the evidence dictate their conclusions. They do not advocate or take policy positions on the issues they fact-check.

2. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF SOURCES
IFCN wants its readers to be able to verify their findings themselves. They provide all sources in enough detail that readers can replicate their work, except in cases where a sourceâ€™s personal security could be compromised. In such cases, they provide as much detail as possible.

3. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF FUNDING & ORGANIZATION
IFCN is transparent about its funding sources. If they accept funding from other organizations, they ensure that funders have no influence over the conclusions their network members reach in their reports. They detail the professional background of all key figures in their organization and explain their organizational structure and legal status. They clearly indicate a way for readers to communicate with them.

4. A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY OF METHODOLOGY
IFCN explain the methodology they use to select, research, write, edit, publish and correct their fact checks. They encourage readers to send them claims to fact-check and are transparent on why and how they fact-check.

5. A COMMITMENT TO OPEN AND HONEST CORRECTIONS
They publish their corrections policy and follow it scrupulously. They correct clearly and transparently in line with their corrections policy, seeking so far as possible to ensure that readers see the corrected version.
