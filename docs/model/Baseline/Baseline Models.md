# Baseline Model Report

_Baseline model is the the model a data scientist would train and evaluate quickly after he/she has the first (preliminary) feature set ready for the machine learning modeling. Through building the baseline model, the data scientist can have a quick assessment of the feasibility of the machine learning task._

When applicable, the Automated Modeling and Reporting utility developed by TDSP team of Microsoft is employed to build the baseline models quickly. The baseline model report is generated from this utility easily. 

> If using the Automated Modeling and Reporting tool, most of the sections below will be generated automatically from this tool. 

## Analytic Approach
* What is target definition
* What are inputs (description)
* What kind of model was built?

## Model Description

* Models and Parameters

	* Description or images of data flow graph
  		* if AzureML, link to:
    		* Training experiment
    		* Scoring workflow
	* What learner(s) were used?
	* Learner hyper-parameters


## Results (Model Performance)
* ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
* Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable

## Model Understanding

* Variable Importance (significance)

* Insight Derived from the Model



## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps

* Conclusion on Feasibility Assessment of the Machine Learning Task

* Discussion on Overfitting (If Applicable)

* What other Features Can Be Generated from the Current Data

* What other Relevant Data Sources Are Available to Help the Modeling
